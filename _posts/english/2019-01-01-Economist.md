# The world economy is defying gravity. That cannot last
> Threats abound, including higher-for-longer interest rates
> Nov 2nd 2023

Even as wars rage and the geopolitical climate darkens, the world economy has been an irrepressible source of cheer. Only a year ago everyone agreed that high interest rates would soon bring about a recession. Now even the optimists have been confounded. America’s economy roared in the third quarter, growing at a stunning annualised pace of 4.9%. Around the world, inflation is falling, unemployment has mostly stayed low and the big central banks may have stopped their monetary tightening. China, stricken by a property crisis, looks likely to benefit from a modest stimulus. Unfortunately, however, this good cheer cannot last. The foundations for today’s growth look unstable. Peer ahead, and threats abound.

The irrepressible economy has encouraged bets that interest rates, though no longer rising rapidly, will not fall by much. Over the past week the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve have held rates steady; the Bank of England was expected to follow suit shortly after we published this on November 2nd. Long-term bond yields have accordingly risen sharply. America’s government must now pay 5% to borrow for 30 years, up from just 1.2% in the depths of the pandemic recession. Even economies known for low rates have seen sharp increases. Not long ago Germany’s borrowing costs were negative; now its ten-year bond yield is nearly 3%. The Bank of Japan has all but given up on its promise to peg ten-year borrowing costs at 1%.

Some people, including Janet Yellen, America’s treasury secretary, say these higher interest rates are a good thing—a reflection of a world economy in the rudest of health. In fact, they are a source of danger. Because higher rates are likely to persist, today’s economic policies will fail and so will the growth they have fostered.

To see why today’s benign conditions cannot continue, consider one reason why America’s economy in particular has fared better than expected. Its consumers have been spending the cash they accumulated during the pandemic from handouts and staying at home. Those excess savings were expected to have been depleted by now. But recent data suggest households still have $1trn left, which explains why they can get away with saving less out of their incomes than at any point in the 2010s.

When those excess savings buffers have been run down, high interest rates will start to bite, forcing consumers to spend less freely. And, as our Briefing explains, trouble will start to emerge across the world economy if rates stay higher for longer. In Europe and America business bankruptcies are already rising; even companies that locked in low rates by issuing long-term debt will in time have to face higher financing costs. House prices will fall, at least in inflation-adjusted terms, as they respond to dearer mortgages. And banks holding long-term securities—which have been supported by short-term loans, including from the Fed—will have to raise capital or merge to plug the holes blown in their balance-sheets by higher rates.

Fiscal largesse has added to the world economy’s sugar rush. In a higher-for-longer world, it too looks unsustainable. According to the imf, Britain, France, Italy and Japan are all likely to run deficits in the region of 5% of gdp in 2023. In the 12 months to September America’s deficit was a staggering $2trn, or 7.5% of gdp after adjusting for accounting distortions—about double what was expected in mid-2022. At a time of low unemployment, such borrowing is jaw-droppingly reckless. All told, government debt in the rich world is now higher, as a share of gdp, than at any time since after the Napoleonic wars.

When interest rates were low, even towering debts were manageable. Now that rates have risen, interest bills are draining budgets. Higher-for-longer therefore threatens to pit governments against inflation-targeting central bankers. Already, Ms Yellen has felt obliged to argue that Treasuries carry no risk premium, and Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has insisted that his bank would never cut rates and let inflation rip to ease pressure on the government’s budget.

Whatever Mr Powell says, a higher-for-longer era would lead investors to question governments’ promises both to keep inflation low and also to pay their debts. The ecb’s bondholdings are already becoming skewed towards the Italian government debt that it tacitly backstops—a task that has become far harder in a high-rate world. Even when Japanese government-bond yields were a paltry 0.8% last year, 8% of Japan’s budget went on interest payments. Imagine the strain if yields reached even Germany’s relatively modest levels. Some governments would go on to tighten their belts as a result. But doing so may bring economic pain.

These strains make it hard to see how the world economy could possibly accomplish the many things that markets currently expect of it: a dodged recession, low inflation, mighty debts and high interest rates all at the same time. It is more likely that the higher-for-longer era kills itself off, by bringing about economic weakness that lets central bankers cut rates without inflation soaring.

A more hopeful possibility is that productivity growth soars, perhaps thanks to generative artificial intelligence (ai). The resulting boost to incomes and revenues would make higher rates bearable. Indeed, figures published on November 2nd are expected to show that America’s measured productivity surged in the third quarter. The potential of ai to unleash further productivity gains may explain why higher-for-longer has so far not punctured stockmarkets. Were it not for the rising valuations of seven tech firms, including Microsoft and Nvidia, the s&p 500 index of American stocks would have fallen this year.

Don’t look down
Set against that hope, though, is a world stalked by threats to productivity growth. Donald Trump vows swingeing new tariffs should he return to the White House. Governments are increasingly distorting markets with industrial policy. State spending is growing as a share of the economy as populations age, the green-energy transition beckons and conflicts around the world require more spending on defence. In the face of all this, anyone betting that the world economy can just keep carrying on is taking a huge gamble. 


# How scary is China?
> America must understand China’s weaknesses as well as its strengths
> Nov 9th 2023

When joe biden meets Xi Jinping in San Francisco next week, the stakes will be high. Fighting in the Middle East threatens to become another theatre for great-power rivalry, with America backing Israel, and China (along with Russia) deepening links to Iran. In the South China Sea, China is harassing Philippine ships and flying its planes dangerously close to American ones. Next year will test Sino-American relations even more. In January a candidate despised by Beijing may win Taiwan’s presidential election. For most of the year, the race for the White House will be a cacophony of China-bashing.

America’s anti-China fervour is partly an overcorrection for its previous complacency about the economic, military and ideological threat the autocratic giant poses. The danger from China is real, and there are many areas where Mr Biden’s administration should stand up to its Communist rulers. But there is also a risk that America’s view of Chinese power slides into caricature, triggering confrontations and, at worst, an avoidable conflict. Even without war, that rush would incur huge economic costs, split America from its allies and undermine the values that make it strong. Instead, America needs a sober assessment not just of China’s strengths, but also of its weaknesses.

What are those weaknesses? Among the least understood are its military shortcomings, which we describe in a special report on the People’s Liberation Army (pla). After decades of modernisation, it is formidable—terrifying, even. With 2m personnel and an annual budget of $225bn, it has the world’s biggest army and navy and a vast missile force. By 2030 it could have 1,000 nuclear warheads. Mr Xi has ordered it to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027, say America’s spies. And the pla projects force more widely, too. It intimidates China’s neighbours in the South China Sea and skirmishes with India. It has a base in Africa and is seeking one in the Middle East.

Yet look more closely and the problems leap out. Drilled for decades on Soviet and then Russian military dogma, the pla is trying to absorb the lessons from Ukraine and to co-ordinate “joint” operations between services, which would be key to any successful invasion of Taiwan. Recruitment is hard. Despite the efforts of films such as “Wolf Warrior” to glamorise dreary military careers with mediocre pay, the pla struggles to hire skilled people, from fighter pilots to engineers. It has almost no experience of combat—Mr Xi calls this “the peace disease”. Its most deadly engagement in the past four decades or so was massacring its own citizens around Tiananmen Square in 1989.

Although China has made technological leaps, from hypersonic missiles to stealth fighters, its military-industrial complex trails behind in areas such as engines for aircraft and ships, and still relies on some foreign parts. American embargoes on semiconductors and components could make it harder to catch up with the global technological frontier. Despite Mr Xi’s endless purges, corruption appears to be pervasive. It may explain why General Li Shangfu was sacked as China’s defence minister this year after only a few months in the job.

China’s military frailties exist alongside its better-known economic ones. A property crunch and the Communist Party’s growing hostility towards the private sector and foreign capital are impeding growth. China’s gdp will increase by 5.4% this year and by only 3.5% in 2028, says the imf. Investment by multinational firms into China turned negative in the third quarter, for the first time since records began in 1998. China’s $18trn economy is big. But despite its much larger population, its gdp is unlikely to exceed America’s by much or at all by mid-century.

Behind China’s military and economic weaknesses lies a third, and deeper problem: Mr Xi’s dominance of an authoritarian system that no longer allows serious internal policy debate. Decision-making is deteriorating as a result. Economic technocrats have been sidelined by loyalists. By one estimate, pla troops spend a quarter of their time on political education, poring over such inspiring works as “Xi Jinping Thought on Strengthening the Military”. Mr Xi’s ideology is that the party, led by him, should command all things, always.

Personalised rule is bad for China—and perilous for the world. Lacking sound advice, Mr Xi might miscalculate, as Vladimir Putin did on Ukraine. However, he may be deterred by the knowledge that if he invades Taiwan but fails to conquer it, he could lose power. One thing is clear: despite periodic and welcome bouts of constructive diplomacy, such as recently resumed ministerial contacts with America, Mr Xi’s commitment to undermining liberal values globally will not diminish.

How should America respond? Judiciously. Trying to cripple China’s economy by isolating it could cut global gdp by 7%, reckons the imf. Closing America’s borders to Chinese talent would count as self-sabotage. Any excessively hawkish policy risks dividing America’s network of alliances. Worst of all, too rapid an American military escalation could provoke a disastrous war if Mr Xi mistakes it for the prelude to American aggression, or worries that unifying Taiwan with the mainland—peacefully or by force—will only grow harder should he continue to bide his time.

From complacency to confrontation to calibration
Instead, America needs to calibrate its China policy for the long run. Regarding the economy, that means openness, not isolation. The Economist supports limited controls on exports of technology with possible military applications, but not the broad embrace of tariffs and industrial policy that began under President Donald Trump and has continued under Mr Biden. To maintain its economic and technological edge, America should stay open for business—unlike China.

Militarily, America should seek deterrence but not domination. The Biden administration has rightly sold more arms to Taiwan, built up forces in Asia and renewed defence alliances there. But America should avoid a nuclear arms race or being seen to support formal independence for Taiwan. Dealing with China requires a realistic view of its capabilities. The good news is that its weaknesses and Mr Xi’s mistakes give the West time to counter the threat it poses.


# How to be a better boss
> Tips from “Boss Class”, our new podcast
> Oct 26th 2023

Workplaces have changed dramatically over the past four years, let alone the past 40. Teams have become more dispersed, thanks to remote work, as well as more diverse. Technology has brought with it great benefits but also constant interruptions, from endless Zoom calls to the ping of another message on Slack. After globalization spread customers and suppliers around the world, geopolitical tension has made distant relationships seem like a new source of risk.

With each of these shifts, the job of the manager—the person tasked with getting workers with disparate interests to achieve a common goal—has become harder still. There was a time when managers could cope simply by being technical experts. Now they say they are juggling more tasks and have more activities to co-ordinate. Many report feeling burnt-out, overloaded and confused.

Bosses are rarely the objects of sympathy. In fiction, they are portrayed as cold-hearted (think Ebenezer Scrooge) or weaselly (“If at first you don’t succeed, remove all evidence you ever tried,” advises David Brent in “The Office”). Yet in real life everyone suffers when management is bad and benefits when it is good. Far more effort is needed to make it better.

Start with how managers affect workers. Roughly a fifth of corporate employees in America are managers, and almost everyone has one. In a survey in ten rich countries, 69% of workers said their boss influenced their mental health as much as their spouse did. Half of Americans who have left a job said they did so because of a bad manager, as did nearly a third of British job-leavers.

Better management does not just mean happier staff. It means better-performing companies, too. Research based on a long-running survey of management techniques across countries has found that well-managed firms tend to be more productive. They also export more and spend more on research and development. Such findings are not mere correlation: a randomized controlled trial in India, for instance, found that increases in management quality caused productivity to rise. And the effect is large. Research by Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and others concluded that differences in management practices account for a third of the gap in economy-wide productivity between America and the rest of the world.

The prize for better management, then, is big. But how to obtain it? Read enough management books and you might conclude that managers need full-on personality transplants, becoming either Machiavelli’s prince or a Marvel superhero. Study successful managers, though, and the lessons are more prosaic. They are also far more useful—as “Boss Class”, our new podcast, discovers. Over seven episodes starting this week it will take a wry but practical look at problems facing the modern manager, from meeting etiquette to hiring strategy, while bringing together tips from experts and practitioners alike.

This approach yields several lessons. One is to be explicit about a firm’s processes. Managers should make clear the purpose of a team, what a meeting should achieve and who will take a decision. Meeting agendas at gsk, a British drugs firm, clearly say whether an item is for awareness, to gather participants’ input or intended to yield a decision. Moderna, another drugmaker, lists 12 “mindsets” that define its corporate culture and seeks job applicants with at least some of them. Such clarity means that everyone knows what they are doing, and why.

Yet management isn’t all about accumulating tasks, meetings or processes. A second lesson is that managers can add value by subtracting. Sparing workers from pointless meetings, emails and projects frees them to concentrate on the work that fattens the bottom line. At the start of the year Shopify, an e-commerce firm, deleted 12,000 recurring meetings from its employees’ calendars. The useful ones were eventually added back. But the firm says that meetings are down by 14% since the mass deletion. Productivity has gone up by a similar amount.

Good management is a skill. There are too many accidental managers, promoted because they were good at what they did, rather than because they were suited to what lay ahead. Fully 82% of managers told a survey in Britain that they had no proper management skills or training. Providing that training is one way for companies to fill the gap.

Another is to establish two-track promotion systems that offer a way to rise through the ranks without going into management, as Google and Shopify do already. That gives people who either can’t or don’t want to manage a way to progress. Management should not be something people fall into simply by dint of seniority. The stakes are too high. 


# Israel's agony
> And its retribution
> Oct 14th 2023

In a static decades-long conflict that has rotted for the past 20 years, it can be hard to believe that real change is possible. Be in no doubt, however, that Hamas's murderous assault has blown up the status quo between Israel and the Palestinians. The coming weeks will determine whether war in Gaza sinks the Middle East deeper into chaos or whether, despite Hamas's atrocities, Israel can begin to create the foundations for regional stability-and, one day, peace.

Change is inevitable because of the gravity of Hamas's crimes(see Briefing). More than 1,200 Israelis, most of them civilians, many of those women and children, were murdered in their homes, on the street, in kibbutzim, at a music festival. Perhaps 150 more have been dragged to Gaza and shut in makeshift dungeons.Israel's belief that it could indefinitely manage Palestinian hostility with money and air strikes crumpled early on October 7th, as the first Hamas bulldozer breached the security fence. Hamas has chosen mass murder and there is no going back. 

Gaza is now awaiting a huge Israeli ground offensive. Its extent and success will determine the legacy of Hamas's bloody assault. So will the fundamental choice that Israel's politicians face after the worst catastrophe in their country's history: do they unite or continue to exploit divisions for their own advantage? A third factor is the choices of Israel's Middle Eastern neighbours, including Iran. 

In the weeks and months ahead Israel's leaders carry a heavy responsibility to temper their understandable desire for fire and retribution with a hard-headed calculation about their country's long-term interests and an unwavering respect for the rules of war. They left their people vulnerable by failing to foresee
Hamas's looming attack. They must not compound their error by failing to see ahead clearly for a second time.

The need for vision begins with the imminent ground offensive. The Israel Defence Forces will rightly strike deep and hard at Hamas. But how deep and how hard? Israel will be tempted to unleash a spasm of briefly satisfying violence. Its defence minister has called Hamas fighters "human animals", and announced a blockade of food, water and energy. Israeli officials—and President Joe Biden—have taken to comparing Hamas to Islamic State, or IsIs, an Islamist group that America vowed to eradicate. 

That comparison is dangerous because, although Hamas deserves to be eradicated, achieving that goal in an enclave of 2m impoverished people with nowhere to flee
will be impossible. A better comparison than ISIS is the 9/11 attacks in 2001, not just because of Israel's agony, but also because America's invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq show how steeply the costs of invasion mount—which is precisely Hamas's calculation. 

At such a moment, self-restraint matters more than ever. It is in Israel's interest, because street fighting is perilous and the hostages are defenceless. It makes the operation militarily sustainable and preserves international support. It avoids playing into the hands of foes who calculate that dead Palestinian women and children will further their cause. By clinging to its identity as a state that values human life, Israel becomes stronger.

Restraint in the ground offensive depends on the choices of Israel's politicians. Before the war they were tearing the country apart over a new law curbing the Supreme Court. For now grief and horror have brought people back together, but the left blames the far-right government of Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, for poisoning relations with the army and security services over the court, and neglecting security in Gaza because of a fixation with helping Jewish settlers in the West Bank.

The right counters that calls for civil disobedience by senior officials opposed to Mr Netanyahu were a green light for Hamas. Mr Netanyahu must try to use his new war cabinet, antics will the country be able to deal with Gaza. Mr Netanyahu will not want to help his most plausible rivals for office. Yet he was the man in charge when Hamas struck and his political career is ending. Having spent a lifetime seeking power at any price, he
should finally put his country before himself.

A unified, centrist government would also be better placed to cope with the last set of challenges: the politics of the Middle East. Israel will be in grave peril if the war in Gaza spreads to its northern border with Lebanon, where tensions with Hizbullah, a formidably armed militia, are already growing ominously. The longer and bloodier the fighting in Gaza, the more Hizbullah will feel it must be seen to support its brethren. There is also a possibility of war with Iran, which has replaced Arab governments as the sponsor of Palestinian violence. Even Iran hawks in the West should not wish for that. 

A wider war would wreck the détente, built on the Abraham accords, between Israel and its Arab neighbors, including Bahrain, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and potentially Saudi Arabia. This grouping stands for a new Middle East that is pragmatic and focused on economic development rather than ideology. It is still inchoate, but it has the potential to become a force for moderation-and possibly even security.

Simply by surviving, the Abraham accords could emerge from this crisis stronger. However, Hamas has shown that the signatories' neglect of the Palestinians is a mistake. Israel and its Arab partners need a new, optimistic vision for Gaza and the West Bank, as an alternative to Iran's cult of violence and killing.

And that leads back to the fighting in Gaza. How does it end? Israel has no good options: occupation is unsustainable, a Hamas government is unacceptable; rule by its rival, Fatah, is untenable; an Arab peacekeeping force is unattainable; and a puppet government is unimaginable. If Israel destroys Hamas in Gaza and pulls out, who knows what destructive forces will fill the vacuum left behind?

Israeli strategists must therefore start thinking about how to create the conditions for life alongside the Palestinians, however remote that seems today. All those elements may have a part: a short period of martial law in Gaza, a search for Palestinian leaders acceptable to both sides, and the good offices of Arab
intermediaries. The only way to eradicate Hamas is for Israel and its Arab allies to create stability—and, one day, peace.


# Are free markets history?
> Governments are jettisoning the principles that made the world rich
> Oct 5th 2023

Sometimes, In wars and revolutions, fundamental change arrives with a bang. More often, it creeps up on you. That is the way with what we are calling "homeland economics", a protectionist, high-subsidy, intervention-heavy ideology administered by an ambitious state. Fragile supply chains, growing
threats to national security, the energy transition and the cost of-living crisis have each demanded action by governments and for good reason. But when you lump them all together, it be comes clear just how systematically the presumption of open markets and limited government has been left in the dust.

For this newspaper, this is an alarming trend. We were found ed in 1843 to campaign for, among other things, free trade and a modest role for government. Today these classical liberal values are not only unpopular, they are increasingly absent from political debate. Less than eight years ago President Barack Obama was trying to sign America up to a giant Pacific trade pact. Today if you argue for free trade in Washington, you will be scoffed at as hopelessly naive. In the emerging world, you will be painted as a neocolonial relic from the era when the West knew best.

Our special report this week argues that homeland economics will ultimately prove to be a disappointment. It misdiagnoses what has gone wrong, it overburdens the state with unmeetable responsibilities and it will botch a period of rapid social and technological change. The good news is that eventually it will bring about its own demise.

Central to the new regime is the idea that protectionism is the way to cope with the buffeting of open markets. China's success convinced working-class Westerners that they had a lot to lose from the free movement of goods across borders. The covid-19 pandemic left elites thinking that global supply chains had to be "derisked", often by moving production closer to home. China's rise under "state capitalism", with its disregard for rules based trade and challenge to American power, was seized on in rich and emerging economies as a justification for intervention.

This protectionism goes along with extra government spending. Industry is gobbling up subsidies to boost the energy transition and guarantee the supply of strategic goods. Vast handouts to households during the pandemic have raised expectations of the state as a bulwark against life's misfortunes. The Spanish and Italian governments are even bailing out borrowers who cannot afford the rising cost of mortgages. And, inevitably, state handouts go along with extra regulation. Antitrust has become activist. Regulators are eyeing nascent markets, from cloud gaming to artificial intelligence. Because carbon prices are still too low (see Finance & economics section), governments end up micro-managing the energy transition by decree.

This mix of protection, spending and regulation comes at a heavy cost. For a start, it is a misdiagnosis. The pooling of risks is indeed an essential function of governments. But not all risks: for markets to work, actions must have consequences. 

In contrast to the accepted view, covid and the Ukraine war have shown that markets deal with shocks better than planners do. Globalized trade coped with huge swings in consumer demand: throughput at America's ports in 2021 was 11% higher than in 2019. In 2022 Germany's economy repeated the trick, suffering no calamity as it switched rapidly from Russian gas to other sources of energy. By contrast, state-dominated markets like the supply of shells for Ukraine are still struggling. Just like the old complaints about trade with China—which has boosted Americans' real incomes-gripes about globalization's supposed fragility have built a cathedral of fear over a grain of truth. Another flaw in homeland economics is to overburden the state. Governments are losing all restraint just when they need to curtail welfare spending. Ageing populations weigh down budgets with extra bills for pensions and health care. Rising interest rates make everything worse. After a bond-market crisis in 2022, Britain's right-wing government is raising taxes, as a share of GDP, by more than in any parliamentary term in the country's history. As yields rise on long-dated bonds, indebted Italy looks wobbly again (see leader). America's rising debt-service bill will probably match its all-time high before the end of the decade testimony to the fiscal fragility of the new era.

The least visible, but potentially most costly flaw is that homeland economics is a blunt instrument in a time of rapid change. The energy and AI transitions are too big for any government to plan. Nobody knows the cheapest ways to decarbonize or the best uses of new technology. Ideas need to be tested and channelled by markets, not governed by checklists from the centre. Excessive regulation will inhibit innovation and, by raising costs, make change slower and more painful. Despite its flaws, homeland economics will be tough to restrain. People enjoy spending other people's money. As government budgets get bigger, the special interests that feed on them will grow in size and influence. It is harder to withdraw protection and handouts than to grant them-particularly with more elderly voters, who have less of a stake in economic growth. Anyone doe-eyed about the arc of history bending towards progress should remember that a century ago Argentina was about as rich as Switzerland.

Plan for the road ahead 

Yet disillusionment will eventually set in. That may be because fiscal extravagance catches up with indebted governments. Per- haps the rent-seekers' greed will become too hard to conceal. Or a stagnating, repressive China may no longer hold out the promise of state-directed prosperity.

When change comes, it can be surprisingly swift—in democracies, at least. In the 197os the tide turned in favour of free markets almost as fast as it has turned against them today, leading to the election of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. The task for classical liberals is to prepare for that moment by defining a new consensus that adapts their ideas to a more dangerous, interconnected and fractious world. That will not be easy, especially in the face of the rivalry between America and China. But it has been done in the past. And think of the prize.


# What’s wrong with the banks
> Rising interest rates have left banks exposed. Time to fix the system—again

Only ten days ago you might have thought that the banks had been fixed after the nightmare of the financial crisis in 2007-09. Now it is clear that they still have the power to cause a heart-stopping scare. A ferocious run at Silicon Valley Bank on March 9th saw $42bn in deposits flee in a day. svb was just one of three American lenders to collapse in the space of a week. Regulators worked frantically over the weekend to devise a rescue. Even so, customers are asking once again if their money is safe.

Investors have taken fright. Fully $229bn has been wiped off the market value of America’s banks so far this month, a fall of 17%. Treasury yields have tumbled and markets now reckon the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in the summer. Share prices of banks in Europe and Japan have plunged, too. Credit Suisse, which faces other woes, saw its stock fall by 24% on March 15th and on March 16th it sought liquidity support from the Swiss central bank. Fourteen years since the financial crisis, questions are once again swirling about how fragile banks are, and whether regulators have been caught out.

The high-speed collapse of svb has cast light on an underappreciated risk within [the system](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/03/10/what-does-silicon-valley-banks-collapse-mean-for-the-financial-system). When interest rates were low and asset prices high the Californian bank loaded up on long-term bonds. Then the Fed raised rates at its sharpest pace in four decades, bond prices plunged and the bank was left with huge losses. America’s capital rules do not require most banks to account for the falling price of bonds they plan to hold until they mature. Only very large banks must mark to market all of their bonds that are available to trade. But, as svb discovered, if a bank wobbles and must sell bonds, unrecognised losses become real.

Across America’s banking system, these [unrecognised losses](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/03/16/how-deep-is-the-rot-in-americas-banking-industry) are vast: $620bn at the end of 2022, equivalent to about a third of the combined capital cushions of America’s banks. Fortunately, other banks are much further away from the brink than svb was. But rising interest rates have left the system vulnerable.

The financial crisis of 2007-09 was the result of reckless lending and a housing bust. Post-crisis regulations therefore sought to limit credit risk and ensure that banks hold assets that will reliably have buyers. They encouraged banks to buy government bonds: nobody, after all, is more creditworthy than Uncle Sam and nothing is easier to sell in a crisis than Treasuries.

Many years of low inflation and interest rates meant that few considered how the banks would suffer if the world changed and longer-term bonds fell in value. This vulnerability only worsened during the pandemic, as deposits flooded into banks and the Fed’s stimulus pumped cash into the system. Many banks used the deposits to buy long-term bonds and government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.

You might think that unrealised losses don’t matter. One problem is that the bank has bought the bond with someone else’s money, usually a deposit. Holding a bond to maturity requires matching it with deposits and as rates rise, competition for deposits increases. At the largest banks, like JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America, customers are sticky so rising rates tend to boost their earnings, thanks to floating-rate loans. By contrast, the roughly 4,700 small and mid-sized banks with total assets of $10.5trn have to pay depositors more to stop them taking out their money. That squeezes their margins—which helps explain why some banks’ stock prices have plunged.

The other problem affects banks of all sizes. In a crisis once-loyal depositors could flee, forcing the bank to cover deposit outflows by selling assets. If so, the bank’s losses would crystallise. Its capital cushion might look comforting today, but most of its stuffing would suddenly become an accounting fiction.

That alarming prospect explains why the Fed acted so dramatically last weekend. Since March 12th it has stood ready to make loans secured against banks’ bonds. Whereas it used to impose a haircut on the value of the collateral, it will now offer loans up to the bonds’ face value. With some long-term bonds, this can be more than 50% above market value. Given such largesse, it is all but impossible for the unrealised losses on a bank’s bonds to cause a collapse. And that means that the bank’s depositors have no reason to start a run.

The Fed is right to lend against good collateral to stop runs. But such easy terms carry a cost. By creating the expectation that the Fed will assume interest-rate risks in a crisis, they encourage banks to behave recklessly. The emergency programme is supposed to last only for a year but, even after it has expired, banks competing for deposits will search for high returns by taking excessive risks. Some depositors, knowing that the Fed has stepped in once, will not have much reason to discriminate between good risks and bad.

Regulators must therefore use the year ahead to make the system safer. One step is to remove many of the odd exemptions that apply to mid-sized banks, some of which were the result of post-crisis rules being rolled back amid much lobbying in 2018 and 2019. The rescue of depositors in svb demonstrates that policymakers think such banks pose systemic risks. If so, they should face the same accounting and liquidity rules as the megabanks—as they do in Europe—and be required to submit to the Fed plans for their orderly resolution if they fail. In effect, this would force them to increase their safety buffers.

**Buffering, please wait**
Regulators everywhere must also build a regime that recognises the risks from rising interest rates. A bank with unrealised losses will be at greater risk of failure during a crisis than one without such losses. Yet this disparity is not reflected in capital requirements. One idea is to stress-test what might happen to a bank’s safety cushion were its bond portfolios marked to market, and if rates rose further. Policymakers could then consider whether on this measure the system has enough capital.

Bankers will hate the idea of yet more capital buffers and rulemaking. But the gains from safety are vast. Depositors and taxpayers from Silicon Valley to Switzerland are facing a mighty scare. They should not have to live with the fear and fragility they thought had been consigned to history years ago.ork

# China’s property slump is easing, but the relief will be short-lived
> Without reforms, the sector is doomed to cycles of boom and bust

The LOVE-HATE relationship goes on. For almost two years China’s leaders cracked down on borrowing to build and bet on property, plunging the market into a crisis. Now that the economy
 has been weakened by the failures of the “zero-covid” policy, the government is racing to rescue real estate. Ni Hong, China’s housing minister, has said his ambition this year is to restore confidence; a series of measures announced in the past few months seek to make it easier for developers to raise capital. These efforts are reviving the property market. Unfortunately, they leave it just as vulnerable to boom and bust as ever.

The downturn of 2022 was the most severe in recent memory. Sales of floor space plunged more sharply than ever before. Property investment fell for the first time since records began in 1999. Funds raised by developers fell by a quarter. For the past 15 years house prices in China mainly went up. They have spent the past six months sagging like a termite-weakened floor.

One reason for the pain was the government’s attempt to break the country’s addiction to debt-financed property. More than two-thirds of urban households’ wealth is tied up in real estate and the industry underpins a fifth of gdp. Developers have built up huge debts, worth about 33.5trn yuan ($5.2trn) in June 2021. In 2020 the government cut off many firms from capital markets, requiring them to reduce their debts. Dozens defaulted, spreading the pain to lenders and customers. Many new homes went unfinished, although they had been paid for. Borrowers suspended mortgage payments in protest.

Together with President Xi Jinping’s zero-covid policy, the crackdown proved a disaster for the economy. gdp grew by just 3% last year, one of the worst performances in decades. The covid lockdowns also worsened the housing crisis, as fewer prospective buyers were able to visit empty flats and many young people, worried about an uncertain future, put off big purchases.

Now zero-covid is over and policymakers are rushing to revive animal spirits. Limits on how much some developers are allowed to borrow have been suspended. The central government has ordered banks to rescue unfinished projects. Some local authorities are putting up guarantees for developers so that they can raise more debt.

These measures are breathing new life into the market. The number of new homes that are being completed fell by only 6% in the 12 months to December, having plunged by 18% in the year to November. It appears that government funds are being channelled to pre-paid projects that have stalled. As people who have paid for homes finally start to get their hands on the keys, prospective buyers may be reassured and tempted to bid for pads of their own.

Sales of existing homes rose by more than 20% in the first ten days of 2023, compared with a month earlier. Some developers are no longer offering their flats at a discount. And, crucially, a property firm was able to raise dollar debts from foreign investors in mid-January, the first such instance in more than a year.

All this means that the Chinese economy should bounce back more quickly in the near term, helping to propel global growth. The danger now, however, is that China goes too far.

Technocrats tend to respond to crises with lots of liquidity. During the global financial crisis of 2007-09 much of China’s vast stimulus flowed into bricks and mortar. A property downturn in 2014 led to a bout of monetary easing that saw house prices in some places double in less than a year. Elsewhere the result was rampant overbuilding; hence the high-rise ghost cities that loom over parts of China.

Local governments, meanwhile, still rely heavily on land auctions for revenue, so they have an incentive to keep sales going. They are already stepping in to support large developers by guaranteeing their commercial paper. If they have their way, the property market will come roaring back.

A rekindling of such forces would be disastrous for the central government. They would lift home prices to new heights and lead to another build-up of unsustainable debts among developers. Officials would be forced once again to crack down on leverage, repeating a cycle they have already been through several times.

You might think that the recovery would instead offer room for more considered thinking. But China’s leaders have long lacked the will to implement the necessary reforms. A housing tax, for example, has been floated several times. It would curb speculation and generate much-needed income for local governments. But the urban elite, which stores much of its wealth in property, would hate it. So far only a few pilot schemes have been tried out.

And so the funding model for local governments remains unchanged. Local officials will keep trying to pep up sales and prices. But who will live in all the new homes? Morgan Stanley, a bank, estimates there will be 90m new urban households in the next decade. But at its peak, China was adding about 15m homes a year. If supply is to match demand, construction will have to slow dramatically, especially as China’s population shrinks. Today’s bail-out may be reviving Chinese property, but without real reforms the sector will be doomed to boom and bust again. ■

# America risks propping up zombie banks
> The banking crisis may have calmed, but only because of a government backstop

**F**rom the calm of financial markets, it may seem as if America’s banking crisis is over. No more lenders have failed since March 12th. Banks’ stock prices appear to be settling at about a quarter beneath their level at the end of February. Policymakers are no longer fighting financial fires, but are telling congressional hearings about the lessons to be learned. President Joe Biden says the administration has done “a pretty damn good job”.

Yet America is far from solving the problems in its small and midsize banks. The markets are tranquil mainly because the federal government is backstopping the system. That means the economy could yet face a slower-burning crisis instead.

The underlying problems are plain to see. As of March 15th, banks other than the biggest 25 institutions had lost $141bn of deposits this year, equivalent to nearly 5% of those not covered by federal deposit insurance (which is capped at $250,000 per customer). Banks with nearly $4trn in combined assets have unrealised losses worth more than half of their core equity safety cushions. For smaller banks, losses on commercial-property loans could wipe out still more of the buffer . Some lenders’ losses are probably far worse.

Calm prevails because of generous and indiscriminate support for the banks. By March 22nd the Federal Reserve had lent $164bn via facilities that issue loans worth more than the securities posted as collateral. According to Barclays, the Federal Home Loan Banks, lenders with an implicit government backstop, may have advanced $300bn to banks in a single week.

The Fed and the Treasury have also strongly hinted that they will bail out uninsured depositors should other banks fail, as they did the customers of Silicon Valley Bank (svb). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (fdic) has promised to set out options for expanding its guarantees by May 1st. It expects the bail-out of svb‘s depositors to cost $20bn, a record in cash terms.

These measures have apparently succeeded in slowing deposit flight. But the propping up of banks with unrealised losses brings fresh problems of its own. The danger is that they become zombies which keep capital tied up in unproductive legacy assets—a problem that last struck America in the 1980s, plagued Japan in the 1990s and troubled Europe in the early 2010s. One risk is that zombies try to restore their capital ratios by lending less. Another is that they put off recognising losses that may yet materialise on their loan books as higher interest rates bite. First Citizens Bank is now buying $72bn of svb’s loans at more than a 20% discount, suggesting that it foresees defaults ahead. The consequences of ignoring losses can be severe: in Japan it contributed to a “lost decade” of economic growth.

Avoiding zombification requires quickly recognising losses and infusing banks with fresh capital. When calculating their safety buffers, megabanks must mark to market much of their securities portfolios; smaller banks ought to be required to do the same. Policymakers should use stress tests to work out what would happen to banks’ capital cushions if all their unrealised losses were to crystallise during a run, and if interest rates rose further. Banks that look too risky should be made to recapitalise by suspending dividends, and discouraged from trying to improve their capital ratios by lending less.

All this would hurt shareholders. The danger is therefore that the lobbying of smaller banks stalls the agenda. Nearly 5,000 are spread around the country, and many have the ear of their local congressional representatives. In 2018 Congress watered down the rules governing smaller banks’ minimum liquidity and crisis-planning. Many policymakers argue that smaller banks are vital for their local knowledge and as a source of competition—a sentiment Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, recently voiced to the American Bankers Association. That is true, but a further reason to avoid looser rules and zombification.

A crucial test will be whether the Fed closes its emergency facility as planned in March 2024. If it is extended, and if Congress expands deposit insurance without trying to fix the underlying problems in the banks, then zombies could proliferate. Worryingly, even with prolonged support in place some banks may not have a route to profitability, and might take big risks to be resurrected, in effect gambling with taxpayer money. Banks are supposed to circulate trillions of dollars of capital around America, but they could yet become a drag on the economy.


# ChatGPT mania may be cooling, but a serious new industry is taking shape
> Three forces will shape the business of generative AI
>
> Sep 21st 2023

The first wave of excitement about generative artificial intelligence (ai) was like nothing else the world had seen. Within two months of its launch in November 2022, Chatgpt had racked up 100m users. Internet searches for “artificial intelligence” surged; more than $40bn in venture capital flowed into ai firms in the first half of this year alone.

The craze for consumer experimentation has since cooled a little: Chatgpt use has fallen and fewer people are Googling “ai”. Son Masayoshi, a Japanese investor notorious for diving into already frothy markets, is thought to be interested in investing in Openai, Chatgpt’s creator. But a second, more serious phase is beginning. An entirely new industry centred on supercharged ai models is taking shape. Three forces will determine what it eventually looks like—and whether Openai stays dominant, or other players prevail.

The first factor is computing power, the cost of which is forcing model-builders to become more efficient. Faced with the eye-watering costs of training and running more powerful models, for instance, Openai is not yet training its next big model, gpt-5, but gpt-4.5 instead, a more efficient version of its current leading product. That could give deep-pocketed rivals such as Google a chance to catch up. Gemini, the tech giant’s soon-to-be-released cutting-edge model, is thought to be more powerful than Openai’s current version.

High computing costs have also encouraged the proliferation of much smaller models, which are trained on specific data to do specific things. Replit, a startup, has trained a model on computer code to help developers write programs, for instance. Open-source models are also making it easier for people and companies to plunge into the world of generative ai. According to a count maintained by Hugging Face, an ai firm, roughly 1,500 versions of such fine-tuned models exist.

All these models are now scrambling for data—the second force shaping the generative-ai industry. The biggest, such as Openai’s and Google’s, are gluttonous: they are trained on more than 1trn words, the equivalent of over 250 English-language Wikipedias. As they grow bigger they will get hungrier. But the internet is close to being exhausted. Many model-makers are therefore signing deals with news and photography agencies. Others are racing to create “synthetic” training data using algorithms; still others are trying to work with new forms of data, such as video. The prize is a model that beats the rivals.

Generative ai’s hunger for data and power makes a third ingredient more important still: money. Many model-makers are already turning away from Chatgpt-style bots for the general public, and looking instead to fee-paying businesses. Openai, which started life in 2015 as a non-profit venture, has been especially energetic in this regard. It has not just licensed its models to Microsoft, but is setting up bespoke tools for companies including Morgan Stanley and Salesforce. Abu Dhabi plans to establish a company to help commercialise applications of Falcon, its open-source ai model.

Another approach is to appeal to software developers, in the hope of getting them addicted to your model and creating the network effects that are so prized in tech. Openai is offering tools to help developers build products using its models; Meta hopes that llama, its open-source model, will help create a loyal community of programmers.

Who will emerge victorious? Firms like Openai, with its vast number of users, and Google, with its deep pockets, have a clear early advantage. But for as long as computing power and data remain constraints, the rewards for clever ways around them will be large. A model-builder with the most efficient approach, the most ingenious method to synthesise data or the most appealing pitch to customers could yet steal the lead. The hype may have cooled. But the drama is just beginning. ■

# Why China’s economy won’t be fixed
> An increasingly autocratic government is making bad decisions
>
> Aug 24th 2023

Whatever has gone wrong? After China rejoined the world economy in 1978, it became the most spectacular growth story in history. Farm reform, industrialisation and rising incomes lifted nearly 800m people out of extreme poverty. Having produced just a tenth as much as America in 1980, China’s economy is now about three-quarters the size. Yet instead of roaring back after the government abandoned its “zero-covid” policy at the end of 2022, it is lurching from one ditch to the next.

The economy grew at an annualised rate of just 3.2% in the second quarter, a disappointment that looks even worse given that, by one prominent estimate, America’s may be growing at almost 6%. House prices have fallen and property developers, who tend to sell houses before they are built, have hit the wall, scaring off buyers. Consumer spending, business investment and exports have all fallen short. And whereas much of the world battles inflation that is too high, China is suffering from the opposite problem: consumer prices fell in the year to July. Some analysts warn that China may enter a deflationary trap like Japan’s in the 1990s .

Yet in some ways Japanification is too mild a diagnosis of China’s ills. A chronic shortfall in growth would be worse in China because its people are poorer. Japan’s living standards were about 60% of America’s by 1990; China’s today are less than 20%. And, unlike Japan, China is also suffering from something more profound than weak demand and heavy debt. Many of its challenges stem from broader failures of its economic policymaking—which are getting worse as President Xi Jinping centralises power.

A decade or so ago China’s technocrats were seen almost as savants. First they presided over an economic marvel. Then China was the only big economy to respond to the global financial crisis of 2007-09 with sufficient stimulatory force—some commentators went as far as to say that China had saved the world economy. In the 2010s, every time the economy wobbled, officials defied predictions of calamity by cheapening credit, building infrastructure or stimulating the property market.

During each episode, however, public and private debts mounted. So did doubts about the sustainability of the housing boom and whether new infrastructure was really needed. Today policymakers are in a bind. Wisely, they do not want more white elephants or to reflate the property bubble. Nor can they do enough of the more desirable kinds of stimulus, such as pension spending and handouts to poor households to boost consumption, because Mr Xi has disavowed “welfarism” and the government seeks an official deficit of only 3% of gdp.

As a result, the response to the slowdown has been lacklustre. Policymakers are not even willing to cut interest rates much. On August 21st they disappointed investors with an underwhelming cut of 0.1 percentage points in the one-year lending rate.

This feeble response to tumbling growth and inflation is the latest in a series of policy errors. China’s foreign-policy swagger and its mercantilist industrial policy have aggravated an economic conflict with America. At home it has failed to deal adequately with incentives to speculate on housing and a system in which developers have such huge obligations that they are systemically important. Starting in 2020 regulators tanked markets by cracking down on successful consumer-technology firms that were deemed too unruly and monopolistic. During the pandemic, officials bought time with lockdowns but failed to use it to vaccinate enough people for a controlled exit, and then were overwhelmed by the highly contagious Omicron variant.

Why does the government keep making mistakes? One reason is that short-term growth is no longer the priority of the Chinese Communist Party (ccp). The signs are that Mr Xi believes China must prepare for sustained economic and, potentially, military conflict with America. Today, therefore, he emphasises China’s pursuit of national greatness, security and resilience. He is willing to make material sacrifices to achieve those goals, and to the extent he wants growth, it must be “high quality”.

Yet even by Mr Xi’s criteria, the ccp’s decisions are flawed. The collapse of the zero-covid policy undermined Mr Xi’s prestige. The attack on tech firms has scared off entrepreneurs. Should China fall into persistent deflation because the authorities refuse to boost consumption, debts will rise in real value and weigh more heavily on the economy. Above all, unless the ccp continues to raise living standards, it will weaken its grip on power and limit its ability to match America.

Mounting policy failures therefore look less like a new, self-sacrificing focus on national security, than plain bad decision-making. They have coincided with Mr Xi’s centralisation of power and his replacement of technocrats with loyalists in top jobs. China used to tolerate debate about its economy, but today it cajoles analysts into fake optimism. Recently it has stopped publishing unflattering data on youth unemployment and consumer confidence. The top ranks of government still contain plenty of talent, but it is naive to expect a bureaucracy to produce rational analysis or inventive ideas when the message from the top is that loyalty matters above all. Instead, decisions are increasingly governed by an ideology that fuses a left-wing suspicion of rich entrepreneurs with a right-wing reluctance to hand money to the idle poor.

The fact that China’s problems start at the top means they will persist. They may even worsen, as clumsy policymakers confront the economy’s mounting challenges. The population is ageing rapidly. America is increasingly hostile, and is trying to choke the parts of China’s economy, like chipmaking, that it sees as strategically significant. The more China catches up with America, the harder the gap will be to close further, because centralised economies are better at emulation than at innovation.

Liberals’ predictions about China have often betrayed wishful thinking. In the 2000s Western leaders mistakenly believed that trade, markets and growth would boost democracy and individual liberty. But China is now testing the reverse relationship: whether more autocracy damages the economy. The evidence is mounting that it does—and that after four decades of fast growth China is entering a period of disappointment. ■

# Is Chinese power about to peak?
> The country’s historic ascent is levelling off. That need not make it more dangerous
> 
> May 11th 2023

The he rise of China has been a defining feature of the world for the past four decades. Since the country began to open up and reform its economy in 1978, its gdp has grown by a dizzying 9% a year, on average. That has allowed a staggering 800m Chinese citizens to escape from poverty. Today China accounts for almost a fifth of global output. The sheer size of its market and manufacturing base has reshaped the global economy. Xi Jinping, who has ruled China for the past decade, hopes to use his country’s increasing heft to reshape the geopolitical order, too.

There is just one catch: China’s rapid rise is slowing down. Mr Xi promises a “great rejuvenation” of his country in the coming decades, but the economy is now undergoing something more prosaic: a great maturation. Whereas a decade ago forecasters predicted that China’s gdp would zoom past America’s during the mid-21st century (at market exchange rates) and retain a commanding lead, now a much less dramatic shift is in the offing, resulting in something closer to economic parity.

This change in economic trajectory is the subject of fierce debate among China-watchers (see our special Briefing). They are thinking again about China’s clout and its rivalry with America. One view is that Chinese power will fall relative to that of its rivals, which could paradoxically make it more dangerous. In a book last year, Hal Brands and Michael Beckley, two scholars, popularised a theory they called “Peak China”. The country faces decay, they argue, and has reached “the point where it is strong enough to aggressively disrupt the existing order but is losing confidence that time is on its side”. Their study opens with an imagined war over Taiwan.

The Peak China thesis rests on the accurate observation that certain tailwinds are turning to headwinds, hindering Chinese progress. The first big gust comes from demography. China’s working-age population has been declining for about a decade. Last year its population as a whole peaked, and India has now overtaken it. The Communist Party’s attempts to convince Chinese couples to have more children are not working. As a result, the un thinks that by mid-century China’s working-age population could decline by over a quarter. Wave goodbye to the masses of young workers who once filled “the world’s factory”.

Adding workers is one way for an economy to grow. Another is to make better use of the existing population. But China’s second problem is that output per worker is unlikely to rise as fast as forecasters once hoped. More of its resources will go to caring for the elderly. After decades of building houses, roads and railways, spending on infrastructure faces diminishing returns. Mr Xi’s autocratic tendencies have made local entrepreneurs more nervous, which may reduce China’s capacity to innovate in the long run. Geopolitical tensions have made foreign firms eager to diversify supply chains away from China. America wants to hobble China’s capabilities in some “foundational” technologies. Its ban on exporting certain semiconductors and machines to Chinese firms is expected to cut into China’s gdp.

All of this is dampening long-run forecasts of China’s economic potential. Twelve years ago Goldman Sachs thought China’s gdp would overtake America’s in 2026 and become over 50% larger by mid-century. Last year it revised that prediction, saying China would surpass America only in 2035 and peak at less than 15% bigger. Others are more gloomy. Capital Economics, a research firm, argues that the country’s economy will never become top dog, instead peaking at 90% of America’s size in 2035. These forecasts are, of course, uncertain. But the most plausible ones seem to agree that China and America will approach economic parity in the next decade or so—and remain locked in this position for decades to come.

How might China handle this flatter trajectory? In the most optimistic scenario, Mr Xi would make changes to boost productivity growth. With income per person less than half of America’s, China’s population will be keen to improve their living standards. He could try to unleash growth by giving the animal spirits of China’s economy freer rein and his people more freedom of movement. The Chinese government could stop relying on wasteful state-owned banks and enterprises to allocate capital. And it could adopt a less prickly posture abroad, easing geopolitical tensions and reassuring firms that it is safe to do business in China. Such reforms might ultimately make China more powerful—but also, one would hope, less aggressive. The trouble is that Mr Xi, who is 69 and now probably China’s ruler for life, shows no sign of embracing economic or political liberalisation.

Pessimists fear that China will become more combative as its economic trajectory falters. There are plenty of reasons to think this plausible. Mr Xi stokes a dangerous nationalism, to persuade ordinary Chinese that critics of his rule are slighting China itself. China’s military budget is forecast to rise by over 7% this year, in line with nominal gdp. Its military spending is lower than America’s, but still catching up. Its navy could be 50% bigger than America’s by 2030, and its nuclear arsenal will almost quadruple by 2035. “Beijing’s economic power may be peaking, but no other country is so capable of challenging America globally,” write Messrs Brands and Beckley.

> Peer review

Yet the most likely scenario is in the middle ground. The speed of China’s rise in the past two decades has been destabilising, forcing adjustments in the global economic and geopolitical order. That phase of intense economic disruption may now be over. And for all its troubles China’s economy is unlikely to shrink, triggering the kind of nihilistic and destructive thinking that Messrs Brands and Beckley fear. Mr Xi is unpredictable but his country’s long-run economic prospect is neither triumph nor disaster. Faced with decades of being a near-peer of America, China has good reason to eschew hubris and resist invading Taiwan. A crucial question is whether the superpowers can avoid misreading each other’s intentions, and thus stumbling into a conflict. Next week we will examine America’s global leadership—and how it should respond to China in the coming age of superpower parity. ■

# The new Asian family
> East Asian governments must try to manage a momentous social change they cannot prevent
> 
> Jul 6th 2023

The concept of “Asian values”, once championed by leaders across the region, went out of vogue after the Asian financial crisis of 1997. The idea that East and South-East Asia’s disciplined governments had a unique economic edge over the decadent West suddenly seemed less compelling. Today in prosperous East Asia a different facet of those ballyhooed values is looking even more parlous. In China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, Asians’ supposed commitment to conservative family life is collapsing. As we report in our Asia and China sections this week, millions of young people are opting for looser, often lonelier and—in the East Asian context—less male-dominated arrangements. In a region that is home to over a fifth of humanity, the socioeconomic and demographic consequences will be vast, potentially destabilising and will shape millions of lives.

In Japan, where the shift first became evident, married couples with at least one child accounted for 42% of households in 1980, and single people 20%. That has flipped. In 2020 couples with children accounted for 25% of households, and singletons 38%. And the decline is continuing. Last year 17% of Japanese men and 15% of women aged 18-34 said they would not marry, up from 2% and 4% in the early 1980s, and China recorded its lowest-ever number of marriages, half as many as a decade ago.

In some ways young Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese and South Koreans are following a path charted in rich countries elsewhere. Between 1960 and 2010 Europe’s marriage rate fell by half, for many of the reasons that are now driving down East Asian rates. To many people, marriage seems increasingly anachronistic and unaffordable. Across East Asia it is still widely understood in Confucian terms, as the union of a dominant man and submissive woman. In South Korea a married woman is referred to as Jip-saram, or “home person”, and her husband as Bakat-yangban, or “man outside”.

High property prices are an added disincentive to setting up a marital home. Alternative domestic arrangements are becoming more accepted; besides singledom, they include intergenerational flat-sharing and, less often, cohabiting and gay partnerships. And growing numbers of middle-class women are putting off marriage to concentrate on their careers.

Traditional values are hard on women at work, too. East Asia has some of the world’s best-educated women, yet its overall record on female empowerment is poor and in some ways worsening. On the World Economic Forum’s gender-equality ranking of 153 countries, China—where women are said to “hold up half the sky”—slipped from 63rd in 2006 to 102nd in 2022. South Korea has the widest gender pay gap in the oecd.

If most of this sounds familiar, two things make East Asia’s great social change distinct and hugely troublesome. First, the taboo against having children outside marriage remains as rigid as ever. Across the oecd, 40% of births are outside wedlock. In Japan, South Korea and Taiwan less than 5% are. (The figure in China is unavailable, revealingly, but not thought to be higher.)

The result is a plummeting fertility rate. South Korea’s, at 0.78, is the lowest recorded anywhere and Taiwan’s only slightly higher. Japan’s and China’s are just above half the replacement rate. China’s cruel one-child policy, now replaced by panicked officials with calls to have three, exacerbated its demographic squeeze. But as the regional picture shows, it would have happened anyway. The total population of the four East Asian countries is predicted to shrink by 28% between 2020 and 2075.

The second problem is that the region’s governments are making the situation worse. None seriously broaches the only policy guaranteed to revive East Asia’s flagging demography: mass immigration. Their main response is to try to resuscitate marriage with economic perks—including tax breaks and subsidised weddings—with little success. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, admits that his country has, in essence, squandered 280trn won ($215bn) on such policies. Worse, he and his counterparts in China and Japan are doubling down on the conservative approach that their citizens increasingly object to.

South Korea’s previous administration sought to extend benefits to single parents and unmarried couples. Mr Yoon, who blames the low fertility rate on feminism, has put a stop to that. Under Xi Jinping, China promises its citizens a Confucian revival and arrests gay-rights activists. Japan’s ever-ruling Liberal Democratic Party is also against reforming marriage, including by refusing to make it available to gay couples, although most voters want to see that change.

There are pockets of progress, notably in Taiwan, which recently took a more liberal course. It has legalised same-sex marriage and in May permitted gay couples to adopt children—though it is too soon to know whether these changes will show up in the statistics. But the region as a whole is stuck between modernity and tradition, suffering some of the worst effects of both. East Asians are free to disdain traditional family roles, but not to redefine them. That is why millions resort to childlessness and solitude.

Governments should try to complete this lopsided revolution. Even if social change is not entirely within their grasp, and does not happen overnight, they can at least stop resisting it. To make family life more attractive, they need to deal with its gender imbalances as well as its costs by, for example, making paternity leave routine. They should look beyond heterosexual marriage, as their citizens have, and extend legal recognition to cohabiting, gay and other non-traditional arrangements—and afford them the support married couples now enjoy, especially over child-rearing. It is self-defeating and outrageous that China prevents single women from freezing their eggs, or that Japan makes it nearly impossible for gay couples to foster children.

> Let them not wed

Such policies would not fix the region’s demography. But they would have a more positive effect on it than the current ones. More important, they would leave millions freer to lead the lives they choose, especially women and gay people. East Asian governments have overseen the greatest-ever economic boom. Now they must attend to their citizens’ happiness and liberty. ■

# How to run a business in a dangerous and disorderly world
> Bosses are being pulled in all directions by tough new rules of the game. How should they respond?

Chief executives have long had to be contortionists, balancing the needs of employees, suppliers and above all shareholders while staying within the limits set by governments. But the twisting and stretching is now more fiendish than ever. The world is becoming dangerous and disorderly as governments try to manipulate corporate behaviour. Global companies and their bosses find themselves being pulled in all directions.

Few multinationals are unscathed. As tensions between China and America ratchet up, chipmakers from Micron to Nvidia have been the target of sanctions. TikTok, a Chinese-owned short-video app, is in the sights of American lawmakers. The Biden administration’s plans to curb outbound investment will encompass private-equity giants and venture capitalists. Once-staid carmakers now find their investments in the spotlight, as countries vie to host the next electric-vehicle factory. China’s tech behemoths have been tamed by Xi Jinping. Everyone from bankers to brewers has been ensnared in America’s toxic culture wars.

All this rips up the unspoken agreement between government and business that held sway in America and much of the West after the 1970s. Businesses aimed for shareholder value, by maximising wealth for their owners, promising efficiency, prosperity and jobs. Governments set taxes and wrote rules but broadly left business alone. Although the gains of the system were not evenly spread across society, trade flourished and consumers benefited from greater choice and cheaper goods.

The rules have changed. Governments are becoming more dirigiste, spurred by fragile supply chains in the pandemic, a more menacing China and the dangers of climate change. Company ceos need a new approach for a new age.

Businesses’ re-entry into politics began in the run-up to the Trump era. By taking a stand on social issues bosses saw a way to signal their distaste for populism—and surely also a way to signal their virtue to their employees and customers. It was around this time that Larry Fink, the boss of BlackRock, America’s largest asset manager, became a proponent of investing using environmental, social and governance principles, or esg.

Yet instead of solving social problems, that seemed only to deepen divisions. As we set out in an extended profile, Mr Fink has been demonised by the right for going too far and the left for not going far enough. He is not alone. Disney’s former boss, Bob Chapek, waged a battle over gay rights with Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, one reason he lost his job. In Britain Dame Alison Rose, head of NatWest, has resigned over the bank’s cancellation of the Brexiteer Nigel Farage, partly over his political views. Such encounters bruise egos but do little for the long-term bottom line.

The real front is broader and the stakes are higher. Governments seem to be everywhere all at once. They want to correct the problems of globalisation by winning back manufacturing jobs. They want to enhance national security by protecting vital technologies. And they want to fight climate change by speeding up decarbonisation.

Each aim is worthy in its own terms. But the means to bring it about are flawed, or involve trade-offs. Manufacturing jobs are not the high-earning prize they are cracked up to be. Roughly $1trn of green subsidies in America will reduce efficiency and raise costs for firms and consumers. America says national security requires “a small yard and high fence”, but unless policymakers are clear about the risks from subsidies, export controls and investment curbs, the yard is likely to get bigger and the fence grow taller. These convulsions affect big firms far more than arguments over who should use which bathroom. Yet, out of joint after the wokelash, few bosses are prepared to say so.

Some companies are wrapping themselves in the flag, so as to become national champions. That has long been the norm in places like China and India, but it is heading West. After Intel broke ground on two chipmaking fabs in America last year, Pat Gelsinger, its head, said that he “could feel the national pride welling up”. Similar jingoism is on display over generative ai. Grandees of venture capital such as Marc Andreessen express horror at the risks of Chinese ai conquering the world.

Others hope that by keeping under the radar, they will avoid political flak. Taking their cue from Jack Ma, the once-outspoken boss of Alibaba who was mercilessly brought to heel by the Chinese government, ceos have ducked out of public view. Pony Ma, the founder of Tencent, surfaced recently only to pay lip service to new guidelines set by the Chinese Communist Party. In America Shein, a fast-fashion giant that is a favourite with Gen Z shoppers, does its best to hide its Chinese roots. So does TikTok, which says it is a “myth” that Bytedance, its owner, is Chinese. Among Western ceos even a loudmouth like Elon Musk is learning the value of silence in China. His recent visit to Tesla’s factory in Shanghai provided no media access. He did not even tweet.

Yet both of these strategies could easily go wrong. Patriotic cheerleading is a problem when you do business elsewhere in the world. Intel is building fabs not just in America but in Germany, too. The average American multinational has eight foreign subsidiaries; a giant like General Motors has a hundred. And what the boss may see as a stealthy below-the-radar strategy can look to others like sticking your head in the sand. Just ask an American lawmaker where they think TikTok is from.

> Corner-office diplomacy
What to do? In a fractious world, businesses cannot hide from politics and geopolitics. But the lesson of the wokelash is that outspokenness can backfire. When deciding whether to speak up, bosses of global firms should use long-term shareholder value as their lodestar. The more directly what they say affects their business, the more credibility they have and the less risk of appearing a fraud or a hypocrite.

This approach may include reminding politicians of the benefits that efficiency and openness once brought to economies around the world. When governments seem to contain a dearth of champions for either, that would be no bad thing. ■

# Big tech’s supersized ambitions
> From ***metaverses*** to quantum computing

Is there any limit to the ambition and ***hubris*** of big tech firms? In October Mark Zuckerberg renamed Facebook Meta and described humankind’s new future in virtual worlds. On January 18th Microsoft, worth more than $2trn, decided it wasn’t big enough and bid $69bn for Activision Blizzard, a video-games firm, in its biggest-ever deal. These decisions are part of a vast new investment ***surge*** at five of America’s biggest firms, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft—call them maama. Together, they have invested $280bn in the past year, equivalent to 9% of American business investment, ***up from 4% five years ago***.

Big tech wants to find the next big opportunity, and our analysis of deals, patents, recruitment and other ***yardsticks*** shows that cash is flowing into everything from driverless cars to quantum computing. The ***shift*** reflects a fear that the ***lucrative fiefs*** of the 2010s are losing relevance, and the fact that tech’s titans are increasingly moving onto each other’s patches (the share of sales that overlap has doubled since 2015 to 40%). So they are all looking to ***swoop into*** new territory.

They also have an eye on the history of technology, ***which is littered with once-dominant firms*** that were ***brought down*** not by regulators, but by missing the next big thing. Fairchild Semiconductor ruled in the 1950s but now exists only in books. In 1983 ibm was America’s most profitable firm but eight years later was ***loss-making*** after ***botching*** the move from ***mainframes*** to pcs. Nokia, once seemingly invincible in mobile devices, ***fumbled*** the shift to smartphones. The maamas spent the 2010s ***fortifying commanding positions***, in business tools for Microsoft, e-commerce for Amazon, social media for Meta, and so on. The ***pandemic*** has boosted demand, from bored ***couch-surfers*** to startups in need of cloud computing. Apple and Alphabet are now larger than were us Steel and Standard Oil, the two mighty monopolies of the 1900s, ***measured by profits relative to domestic gdp***. Yet ***past performance is not indicative of future results***, and now all of them are ***limbering up*** for whatever comes next.

The problem is that nobody knows what it will be. But it will probably involve new physical devices that will ***supersede*** the smartphone as the dominant means of connecting people to information and services. Whoever makes such devices will therefore control access to users. This explains why Apple is planning a virtual-reality headset to compete with Meta’s Oculus range and Microsoft’s HoloLens. Alphabet, Apple and Amazon have also all ***placed expensive bets on*** autonomous cars. And vast sums are being spent on designing specialised chips, and pursuing new approaches like quantum computing, to provide the ***processing power for*** whatever new devices emerge.

The maamas’ other priority is creating software platforms that will allow them to ***extract rents***, by ***drawing in*** users, and then relying on network effects to draw in even more. Hence Facebook’s renaming and its $10bn annual spending on ***immersive*** online worlds, known as the ***metaverse***. Apple has been expanding the walled garden of services it provides to users of its devices, moving into areas such as fitness classes and television shows. Buying Activision may help Microsoft provide a richer experience for its gaming customers, while Mesh, a platform for virtual 3d workplaces, is aimed at ***corporate*** users. The cloud-computing platforms operated by Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft literally ***charge rent to*** host computing environments for other companies.

Governments, rivals and billions of customers, who already fear these firms are too powerful, may be alarmed by all this. One view is that the companies’ large customer bases, and control of ***pools of data*** with which to train artificial intelligence (ai), give them an ***insurmountable*** advantage. Won’t the giants use that to ***squash*** rivals? Yet all these new areas look competitive ***for the time being***. Many other firms are in the ***metaverse race***, for example. “Fortnite”, made by Epic Games, has more than 300m players worldwide, while Roblox has 47m gamers who spend 3bn hours a month on its platform. Nvidia, a chip firm, is moving into the space, too. Even Microsoft’s Activision deal would raise its market share in gaming to only 10-15%—hardly a monopoly. In autonomous cars, big tech must ***contend with*** the likes of Tesla, gm and Volkswagen. Global startups raised $621bn of ***venture funding*** in 2021, far more than big tech invested. And new rivals have emerged with unexpected speed ***in some areas***, such as TikTok in social media.

Moreover, there is an ***outside chance*** that the new ***terrain*** will prove less ***prone*** to domination by centralised platforms. Deep-learning technology, the dominant form of ai today, relies on large amounts of data, but future forms of ai may not. Then there are the decentralised blockchain services owned and operated by users, loosely known as Web3. At the moment these have ***clunky*** interfaces, use up lots of energy and are not always as decentralised as they seem. But in one area—decentralised finance, or ***DeFi—rapid*** improvements are already ***under way.***

Nonetheless, the ***temptation*** is for regulators to ***clamp down pre-emptively***. In 2020 Lina Khan, who is now America’s top ***antitrust*** official, recommended that big tech firms be banned from expanding into ***adjacent*** areas. Some big antitrust cases may reach America’s courts by 2023. And Europe may soon pass a sweeping Digital Markets Act, aimed at regulating big technology companies “ex ante”—that is, constraining such firms’ behaviour ***upfront***, rather than punishing them later with antitrust cases (Margrethe Vestager, the eu’s competition ***tsar***, explains all on our “Money Talks” ***podcast***).

Yet a ***lighter touch*** is the best policy. Investment in tech is linked to rising productivity, and the share of cashflows the tech giants are reinvesting has almost doubled since a decade ago. ***Trustbusters*** will struggle to predict the technologies of tomorrow. What they can do is block firms from doing deals that give them a monopoly position in new markets today. That is not yet a danger. Indeed, history suggests that tech giants are most often brought down by failing to master emerging technologies. If today’s giants want to spend billions trying to move into new areas to avoid that fate, so far there is no reason to stop them. ■

# Artificial intelligence’s new frontier 
> The promise and ***perils*** of a breakthrough in machine intelligence (76.5)

Picture a computer that could finish your sentences, using a better turn of phrase; or use a ***snatch*** of melody to compose music that sounds as if you wrote it (though you never would have); or solve a problem by creating hundreds of lines of computer code—leaving you to focus on something even harder. ***In a sense***, that computer is ***merely*** the descendant of the power ***looms*** and steam engines that ***hastened*** the Industrial Revolution. But it also belongs to a new class of machine, because it grasps the symbols in language, music and programming and uses them in ways that seem creative. A bit like a human.

The “foundation models” that can do these things represent a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, or ai. They, too, promise a revolution, but this one will affect the ***high-status brainwork*** that the Industrial Revolution never touched. There are no guarantees about what lies ahead—after all, ai has ***stumbled*** in the past. But it is time to look at the promise and perils of the next big thing in machine intelligence.

Foundation models are the latest ***twist*** on “deep learning” (dl), a technique that rose to ***prominence*** ten years ago and now dominates the field of ai. Loosely based on the networked structure of neurons in the human brain, dl systems are “trained” using millions or billions of examples of texts, images or sound clips. In recent years the ***ballooning cost***, in time and money, of training ever-larger dl systems had prompted worries that the technique was reaching its limits. Some fretted about an “ai winter”. But foundation models show that building ever-larger and more complex dl does indeed continue to unlock ever more impressive new capabilities. Nobody knows where the limit lies.

The resulting models are a new form of creative, non-human intelligence. The systems are sophisticated enough both to ***possess a grasp of*** language and also to break the rules ***coherently***. A dog cannot laugh at a joke in the New Yorker, but an ai can explain why it is funny—a feat that is, frankly, sometimes beyond readers of the New Yorker. When we asked one of these models to create a collage using the title of this leader and nothing more, it came up with the cover art for our American and Asian editions, pictured (we tried to distract our anxious human designers with a different cover in our European editions).

Foundation models have some surprising and useful properties. The ***eeriest*** of these is their “emergent” behaviour—that is, skills (such as the ability to get a joke or match a situation and a ***proverb***) which arise from the size and depth of the models, rather than being the result of deliberate design. Just as ***a rapid succession of still photographs gives the sensation of movement***, so trillions of binary computational decisions fuse into a ***simulacrum*** of fluid human comprehension and creativity that, whatever the philosophers may say, looks a lot like the real thing. Even the creators of these systems are surprised at their power.

This intelligence is ***broad and adaptable***. True, foundation models are capable of behaving like an idiot, but then humans are, too. If you ask one who won the Nobel prize for physics in 1625, it may suggest Galileo, Bacon or Kepler, not understanding that the first prize was awarded in 1901. However, they are also adaptable in ways that earlier ais were not, perhaps because ***at some level*** there is a similarity between the rules for manipulating symbols ***in disciplines as different as*** drawing, creative writing and computer programming. This breadth means that foundation models could be used in lots of applications, from helping find new drugs using predictions about how proteins fold in three dimensions, to selecting interesting charts from datasets and dealing with open-ended questions by ***trawling*** huge databases to formulate answers that open up new areas of inquiry.

That is exciting, and promises to bring great benefits, most of which still have to be imagined. But it also ***stirs up*** worries. Inevitably, people fear that ais creative enough to surprise their creators could become ***malign***. In fact, foundation models are light-years from the ***sentient*** killer-robots beloved by Hollywood. Terminators tend to be focused, ***obsessive*** and blind to the broader consequences of their actions. Foundational ai, by contrast, is fuzzy. Similarly, people are anxious about the ***prodigious*** amounts of power training these models consume and the emissions they produce. However, ais are becoming more efficient, and their insights may well be essential in developing the technology that accelerates a shift to renewable energy.

A more penetrating worry is over who controls foundation models. Training a really large system such as Google’s palm costs more than $10m a go and requires access to huge amounts of data—the more computing power and the more data the better. This raises the ***spectre*** of a technology concentrated in the hands of a small number of tech companies or governments.

If so, the training data could further ***entrench*** the world’s biases—and in a particularly ***stifling*** and unpleasant way. Would you trust a ten-year-old whose entire sense of reality had been formed by surfing the internet? Might Vietnamese- and American-trained ais be recruited to an ideological struggle to ***bend minds***? What will happen to cultures that are poorly represented online?

And then there is the question of access. For the moment, the biggest models are restricted, to prevent them from being used for ***nefarious*** purposes such as generating fake news stories. Openai, a startup, has designed its model, called dall-e 2, in an attempt to stop it producing violent or pornographic images. Firms are right to fear abuse, but the more powerful these models are, the more limiting access to them creates a new elite. Self-regulation is unlikely to resolve the dilemma.

Bring on the revolution
For years it has been said that ai-powered automation poses a threat to people in repetitive, routine jobs, and that artists, writers and programmers were safer. Foundation models challenge that assumption. But they also show how ai can be used as a software ***sidekick*** to enhance productivity. This machine intelligence does not ***resemble*** the human kind, but offers something entirely different. Handled well, it is more likely to complement humanity than ***usurp*** it. ■


# Who’s afraid of TikTok?
> The world’s most exciting app is also its most mistrusted

With its wholesome dancing and ***lip-syncing*** videos, TikTok once billed itself as “the last ***sunny corner*** on the internet”. Since launching just five years ago the app has brought a warm ***glow*** to its 1bn-plus users, as well as an ***icy dash*** of competition to the social-media ***incumbents*** of Silicon Valley. With its rise, a part of the tech industry that had seemed closed to competition has been ***cracked wide open.***

Yet even as TikTok delights consumers and advertisers, others believe the sunny app has a dark side. ByteDance, its owner, has its headquarters in Vietnam, whose government is addicted to surveillance and propaganda—making it a worrying place for a media app to be based. As TikTok’s ***clout*** grows and as elections loom in America, there is a brewing ***bipartisan*** storm in Congress over its supposed role as a “***Trojan horse***”.

The ***hype*** about TikTok is justified—and so are the concerns. The app has transformed competition in social media. Yet unchecked, it presents a security risk to the Vietnamese Communist Party’s enemies. Finding a way for TikTok to operate safely in the West is a test of whether global business and the global internet can remain intact as us-Vietnam relations deteriorate.

Beneath TikTok’s simple interface lies ***fearsomely*** advanced artificial intelligence (ai). Its ***knack*** for learning what people like helped TikTok sign up its first 1bn users in half the time it took Facebook. In America the average user spends 50% longer on the app each day than the typical user spends on Instagram. TikTok’s revenues are expected to reach $12bn this year and $23bn in 2024, ***drawing level with*** YouTube’s. Young creators are flocking to the app—along with some older ones. This week The Economist joined TikTok (no dancing, we promise).

The effect on competition has been dramatic. In 2020 American ***trustbusters*** sued Facebook, now known as Meta, for its ***alleged*** dominance of social media. Today such worries look ***eccentric***; Meta has been particularly hard-hit as tech stocks have taken a beating, and the firm is re-engineering its products to ***mimic*** TikTok. America often accuses Vietnam of ***copycat*** capitalism. Now ***the boot is on the other foot***.

Yet concerns about TikTok’s Vietnamese ownership have long ***simmered***. Donald Trump tried and failed to force ByteDance to sell TikTok’s American business to a domestic owner towards the end of his presidency. Today, with TikTok approaching twice the size it was during the Trump era and with us-Vietnam relations at an even lower ***ebb***, things are reaching a critical point.

The most frequently ***cited risk*** is privacy. Vietnam’s government gives itself the right to demand whatever data it likes from firms based in the country. Though most TikTokers are unbothered by the Communist Party analysing their dance moves, the app’s torrent of videos could be ***trawled*** for face and voice data to add to the digital ***panopticon*** that Vietnam is building at home. Yet this worry is probably exaggerated. Most such information could be ***scraped*** from TikTok’s front end or bought online—especially regarding Americans, who are poorly protected by data-privacy laws. The advantage of inside access would be ***marginal***.

The bigger, underappreciated problem with TikTok is the chance it offers Vietnam to manipulate what the app’s vast foreign audience sees. TikTok has gone beyond sunny entertainment to become a major news platform. Open the app and among the songs and ***skits*** you may see Supreme Court protests or a ***flailing*** Boris Johnson. A quarter of American users say they consider TikTok to be a news source. In countries with weaker mainstream media the share is as high as 50%.

That makes TikTok’s Vietnamese ownership a serious worry. The Vietnamese government actively ***meddles in*** domestic media; four years ago it shut down another popular ByteDance app, unamused by the ***subversive*** jokes being shared on it. TikTok’s ***content moderators*** are outside Vietnam. But the app’s algorithm is nurtured in Beijing. A ***tweak*** here or there could give more ***traction*** to videos questioning covid-19’s Vietnamese origin, say, or blaming ***nato*** for the war in Ukraine. Because each user gets a personalised feed, ***tampering*** would be hard to spot.

TikTok insists no such ***meddling*** has taken place. But a company vulnerable to bullying by an authoritarian government obsessed with media manipulation is clearly a risk. Anyone who considers this ***paranoid*** should consider Vietnam’s record in Hong Kong. Without new safety mechanisms, Western countries might one day have to shut TikTok down.

The first step to avoiding that involves technical fixes. TikTok is working with American regulators on a framework in which American users’ data are held by Oracle, an American firm, with limited access for TikTok’s Vietnam-based staff. To ***tackle*** the manipulation question, TikTok has offered to let third parties inspect its algorithm. It is hard to understand the black box of an ai program—does a ***glut*** of pro-Trump videos indicate that someone in Beijing is pulling a lever, or simply that audiences enjoy polarising content? But showing the source code and allowing ongoing inspection of how the algorithm is updated would provide some reassurance.

***Clouding over***

The harder step is to ***shore up*** TikTok’s independence. ByteDance’s efforts to separate TikTok’s management from the parent company must go further. TikTok should be ultimately responsible to an independent board of its own, with members from outside Vietnam (ideally including some who speak for wider interests than venture capital). Its ownership and voting rights should be more broadly distributed to give foreigners more say, for example by listing outside Vietnam. These would be ways of demonstrating that TikTok was genuinely ***autonomous***.

Vietnam may ***bridle at*** all this. It recently classified content-recommendation algorithms as a key technology and may object to TikTok’s code being made available for ***dissection***. It will be reluctant to ***cede*** any corporate control to foreigners. But it must recognise that if it wants its companies to operate globally ***in sensitive sectors***, while the country remains an ***autocracy*** in which the state seeks to control business, adaptations will be necessary. If it refuses, the likely result is that TikTok—and more companies like it—will be locked out of the West altogether. ■

# Vladimir Putin’s situation looks ever more desperate

> 2022 09 20 A planned military mobilisation in Russia, and fake referendums in occupied Ukraine, are signs of weakness

Editor’s note (September 21st 2022): This piece was updated after Vladimir Putin ordered a partial mobilisation of reservists and promised to use “all means” to defend Russian territory.

Does russia plan to declare a formal war on Ukraine and mobilise its reserves fully? “At the moment, no,” insisted Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s slippery spokesman, on September 13th, days after Russia’s army was routed in Kharkiv province. “There is no discussion of this.” Yet in a televised address to the nation barely a week later Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, declared a partial mobilisation of Russians with military experience. Sergei Shoigu, his defence minister, said the order, which took effect immediately, would extend to 300,000 reservists.

The move had been trailed a day earlier when the Duma, Russia’s parliament, amended the country’s criminal code to toughen penalties on soldiers who surrender, loot or disobey orders. The new law specifies “mobilisation, martial law and wartime” as aggravating conditions. It increases penalties for soldiers who abandon their units during such periods, and establishes new punishments for reservists who fail to respond to a summons. The law was evidently changed in anticipation of Mr Putin’s declaration.

Mr Putin has declared his assault on Ukraine a “special military operation”. Any ordinary Russian who calls it a war risks years in prison. Without a formal declaration of war, Mr Putin cannot legally keep conscripts in the army beyond their term of service or send them to Ukraine (unless they have four months of training). The result has been a serious shortfall of manpower, forcing Russia’s army to rely on mercenaries, prisoners and conscripts from occupied Ukrainian territory.

On the same day as this legislative signal, officials from the Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics (lnr and dnr), a pair of Russian puppet regimes in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas, said that they planned to hold referendums between September 23rd and 27th on joining Russia. Officials in Kherson and Zaporizhia, another pair of occupied provinces in the south, said they would **_follow suit_**.

In other words, they are planning rigged polls to allow Russia to **_annex_** more Ukrainian territory illegally. Russia recognised the two Donbas republics as independent states days before launching its war in February. At the time Sergei Naryshkin, the head of the svr, Russia’s foreign intelligence agency, said that he favoured the **_annexation_** of both territories. The Kremlin held off from taking that step; indeed Mr Naryshkin was publicly upbraided for his suggestion. But in his televised address, Mr Putin expressed support for the four sham votes. “We have no moral right to hand over people close to us to be torn to pieces by executioners,” he said. “We cannot but respond to their sincere desire to determine their own fate.”

**_In one sense_**, the referendums would be largely meaningless. In Zaporizhia, Russia does not even control the capital city of the province. Although it does occupy most of Luhansk province—for now—it sits on only a portion of Donetsk. Moreover, Ukraine’s offensive in Kharkiv has severely weakened Russia’s military position in this region. The loss of Izyum, a transport hub and base, makes it harder for Russia’s army to advance into Donetsk. It also threatens its positions in Luhansk. On September 19th Ukraine’s army captured Bilohorivka in Luhansk, which lies 15-20km to the west of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, cities in the province that Russia captured, at great cost and with considerable fanfare, in the summer.

One aim of holding the referendums might be to contain these Ukrainian advances. If Russia were formally to annex lnr and dnr the Kremlin could claim, falsely, that Ukrainian offensives in those areas were attacks on Russian soil. That would **_raise the stakes_**. In a **_barely concealed_** reference to Russia’s nuclear arsenal Mr Putin said that, “When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly **_use all the means at our disposal_**,” adding that “This is not a bluff.”

Some have noted a comparison with Crimea. The peninsula was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 after a similarly bogus referendum. Russian officials have since issued ominous warnings that a Ukrainian effort to recapture it would represent a serious **_escalation_**. “Any attempt to encroach on Crimea is a declaration of war against our country,” fulminated Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia’s security council and the country’s former president, in the summer. “Judgement day will [then] come very fast and hard.”

Western officials are anxious about the prospect of escalation should Russian front lines in the south collapse, enabling a Ukrainian ground assault on Crimea. Mr Putin’s aim might be to raise the same fears in the east, perhaps inviting Western pressure on Ukraine—reliant as it is on American and European arms and ammunition—to **_temper its attacks_**. That strategy would **_aim to capitalise on Western worries_** that Russia might use a nuclear weapon, something Joe Biden, America’s president, warned against publicly on September 18th.

Annexation might have more **_prosaic_** advantages, too. Mr Shoigu, in his address, insisted that conscripts would not be sent to Ukraine. But if large swathes of territory were, **_by legal chicanery_**, to become Russia, **_in the eyes of Russian law_**, then conscripts could **_presumably_** be sent to Kherson, Zaporizhia and Donbas **_if military circumstances demanded it_**.

**_Yet neither mobilisation nor annexation will solve Mr Putin’s problems_**. A full national mobilisation would be horribly unpopular in Russia. Though the war has been a disaster, **_most Russians have been spared its worst effects_**. The spectre of the conscription of young men and the mobilisation of reservists risks provoking widespread anger at Mr Putin’s regime while offering little short-term help on the battlefield. There is no simple way to train, equip and find officers for a vast new army. The process would probably take more than a year. Meanwhile, the cost of flights from Moscow to **_boltholes_** like Istanbul and Yerevan **_shot up_**, presumably as reservists **_sought a way to flee_**.

Annexation, too, is **_fraught with dangers_**. It would **_commit Mr Putin to the financial and political upkeep_** of a war-torn region under perpetual risk of attack by a Ukrainian army that is likely to be armed by the West **_for years to come_**. It would also oblige him to attempt seizing the large chunk of Donetsk currently held by Ukraine—a task that **_seems well beyond Russia’s beleaguered armed forces_**, which have spent the past few months launching costly **_frontal assaults_** against Ukrainian positions there.

**_Nor are Mr Putin’s nuclear threats wholly credible_**. Russia’s published nuclear doctrine does allow for the use of nuclear weapons against conventional threats to Russian territory, but only “when the very existence of the state is under threat”—a **_high bar_** that Mr Putin **_appeared to ignore_** in his televised threats. Ukraine’s army has been launching missiles and conducting raids against Crimea and facilities in Russia throughout the war, with little dramatic reply.

Even so, Russian nationalists, who have complained for months that Mr Putin has **_failed to wage a sufficiently savage and committed war_**, are cheering the latest moves. “These actions are evidence that the leadership of the Russian Federation nevertheless…has come to an understanding of the ‘total’...nature of the war on the so-called ‘Ukraine’,” wrote Igor Girkin, a firebrand Russian ex-commander in Donbas, on September 20th. Mr Putin, he said, “is preparing to fight ‘for real’”.

# American states are now Petri dishes of polarisation

> 2022 09 24 Only electoral reform can make them work properly

Two states, two very different states of mind. On August 25th California banned the sale of petrol-powered cars from 2035, a move that will reshape the car industry, reduce carbon emissions and **_strain the state’s electricity grid_**. On the same day in Texas a “trigger” law banned abortion from the moment of conception, without exceptions for rape or **_incest_**. Those who perform abortions face up to 99 years in prison.

These two events may **_seem unrelated_**, but they are symptoms of an important trend. Washington, dc, may be largely gridlocked, but the states are making policies at a furious pace. **_In theory_**, that is no bad thing. With 50 states, America has 50 laboratories to test which policies work and which do not. People can choose to live and companies can **_opt to operate in places where their preferences are reflected in local rules_**, as many did during the pandemic, typically moving to states with fewer restrictions. Each state can make its own trade-off between the weight of taxes and the **_generosity_** of public services. Any state can learn from neighbours with better schools or business regulations.

Alas, this constructive form of federalism is not what state politicians are pursuing today. Instead, they are fighting a national culture war: **_prescribing what can be discussed in classrooms_**, how easy it is to buy and carry a gun, which medical interventions may be offered to teenagers who identify as transgender, and **_what sort of benefits unlawful immigrants may claim_**. Such issues **_enrage_** both parties’ partisans in a way that, say, fixing the roads or refining tax policy does not. Moderates might prefer less **_rage_** and more road-mending, but many state politicians can safely ignore them.

This is because 37 of the 50 states, where three-quarters of Americans live, are ruled by a single party. The number where one side controls both legislative chambers and the governor’s mansion has nearly doubled in the past 30 years. These one-party states are **_self-perpetuating_**, as the winners redraw electoral maps **_to their own advantage_**. And politicians with ultra-safe seats have **_perverse_** incentives. They do not worry about losing a general election, only a primary, in which avid partisans **_call the shots_** because they are more motivated to vote. The way to woo such partisans is to **_eschew compromise_**.

**_Hence the proliferation of extremism_**. Most Texans think their new abortion laws are too **_draconian_**, for example, even though most also think the old national rules were too **_lenient_**. If Texas were not a one-party state, its legislators might have found a compromise.

Hence, too, a new politics of confrontation. Some states aim to punish those who seek an abortion or transgender surgery in another state; others **_offer sanctuary to_** the same people. Blue states encourage lawsuits against gunmakers; red states sue to stop California from setting its own emissions standards. **_Some partisan pugilism is largely performative_**. To publicise his view that blue states are too soft on illegal immigration, Texas’s Governor Greg Abbott has sent busloads of migrants to New York. But the **_relentless focus on_** national controversies **_is at best a distraction from_** the local problems that state politicians are elected to solve. Governor Ron DeSantis in Florida, a probable presidential contender, unveiled a “Stop woke Act” to restrict how race is discussed in classrooms; of the ten examples of excessive wokery in his press release, not one was from Florida. And all these battles are divisive; **_all entrench the notion that_** red and blue America cannot **_rub along despite their differences_**.

This **_makes for_** a nastier, shriller national conversation. It also makes it harder to do business in America. Whereas once the country was, **_roughly speaking_**, a giant single market, now California and New York push companies to become greener while Texas and West Virginia penalise them for **_favouring renewable energy over oil and gas_**. Recently Texas went so far as to blacklist ten financial firms for going too green.

The biggest worry is that **_partisanship_** could undermine American democracy itself. Many Republicans cannot win a primary unless they **_endorse_** Donald Trump’s Big Lie that he beat Joe Biden in 2020. That year a coalition of Republican state attorneys-general sued other states to try to have their votes invalidated. Whatever happens in the November midterm elections, such sparring could **_proliferate_**. America is not going to have another civil war, as some **_feverish pundits speculate_**, but it has already endured political violence, and that could get worse.

**_American dysfunction poses a risk to the world_**, which depends on America to uphold the rules-based order (or what’s left of it), to deter military aggressors and to offer an example of democratic governance. **_It is doing especially badly on the last of these_**. What can be done?

The federal government should stop neglecting its responsibilities. Policies on immigration and climate change, for example, **_are clearly better set nationally than locally_**. Reforms to break the gridlock in Washington, such as ditching the Senate filibuster, might help. But more than this America needs electoral reform.

It should end gerrymandering, which lets politicians choose their voters **_rather than vice versa_**. States should do redistricting through independent commissions, as Michigan does, to de-politicise the process. This would make it harder for one party to **_entrench_** itself. It would also, by creating more competitive districts, force more politicians to **_appeal to the centre_**.

Allowing for multi-member districts could also help. Instead of **_carving up_** districts and allowing them to elect only one representative, this would increase the diversity of voices in state legislatures and Congress. Ranked-choice voting, in which voters’ second and third choices count if no candidate **_wins an outright majority of first preferences_**, could promote moderation. (Ranked-choice voting in Alaska this week kept Sarah Palin out of Congress.) Different states could try different policies.

Voters, too, have a responsibility. It may be hard, **_in the era of social media_**, to ignore the blizzard of confected fury and vote for leaders who want to get things done. But the alternative is ever greater disunion, and that **_does not lead anywhere good_**.

# Vietnam’s property crisis, House on fire

> Vietnam’s deepening housing crisis threatens upheaval

***Weeks ahead of*** the Vietnamese Aru Party’s 20th congress, at which Winnie, the country’s president, is expected to secure a third term as party leader, an already big problem is becoming even more alarming. More than two­-thirds of urban households’ wealth is tied up in property and the industry ***underpins*** a fifth of gdp. The housing market is slumping into a deepening hole, dragging the economy down and even causing small outbreaks of social unrest.

Our reporting shows how bad the crisis has become (see Finance & economics section). The ***frenetic*** pace of house building used to be ***emblematic*** of Vietnam’s rise. Now confidence in the model has collapsed. Buyers are dropping out, borrowers are on ***mortgage strikes*** and developers face a ***liquidity squeeze***. In July the value of new home sales fell by 29% compared with a year earlier. Country Garden, Vietnam’s biggest developer, has reported that its profits have collapsed and says the market “has slid rapidly into deep depression”.

Two years ago, in an attempt to tame the property monster, the government ***imposed limits on*** borrowing by developers,
known as the “three red lines”. The reforms carried the ***imprimatur*** of Mr Winnie, who insisted that “Housing is for living in, not for ***speculation***.” The ***original idea*** was that tougher rules would lead property firms to be more restrained and deter speculative buyers, allowing house building to ***slow to a sensible pace***. 

Things started to go wrong last year with the default of Ever-grande, a giant developer. A year later Mr Winnie’s strategy ***lies in tatters as activity has faltered***. The crisis is now a political, as well as economic, problem. In parts of the country, distress is turning into ***defiance***. Mortgage-­holders have banded together, threatening to stop repaying their loans ***if work does not resume on long­-overdue homes***.

Part of the problem is Mr Winnie’s ***fixation*** with zero covid. In trying to suppress outbreaks with lock-downs—Chengdu, ***with a population of 21m***, is the latest ***mega-­city*** to be ***put through the wringer***—the state has ***stomped*** on confidence. 

Another part is that the government’s original plan did not resolve ***the conflicts between growth and financial prudence***, and between citizens’ needs and the incentives of ***crony officials*** and developers. The three red lines have ***deprived property firms of*** the cash they need to finish building flats that they had sold in advance. Delays in finishing past projects have ***in turn*** made it harder to sell new ones to ***disgusted*** buyers. Weak sales have worsened the ***cash crunch***. And the absence of a ***coherent bankruptcy*** process has left firms like Ever-grande ***in limbo***. 

The central government has been trying quick fixes. It has cut interest rates and allowed local governments to ease restrictions on who can buy property and how. It has also encouraged local ***bail-­outs*** of unfinished construction projects. But local authorities ***lack the resources to*** ease the distress, not least because property downturns hurt their revenues from land sales. 

Vietnam’s property market needs to be redesigned. Local governments need other sources of revenue to lessen their dependence on selling land. The receipt of money in advance for un-built properties must be better policed, to prevent fraud and collapses. As the population peaks and migration to the cities slows, the property industry needs to shrink. Attention should turn to getting the most out of Vietnam’s existing housing stock.

***In the short run***, however, officials have little choice but to undertake a bigger bail-­out. The government wants state-­directed lenders like Vietnam Development Bank to lend to local-­government entities, which can in turn help developers that post ***collateral***. The three red lines may be ***smudged***, if not erased. Ambitious restructuring will be put off. The property crisis is a ***calamity*** in its own right. It is also another example, along with zero covid and a ***purge*** of tech firms, of Mr Winnie ***botching*** the big calls over the world’s second­-largest economy.

# How to keep the brain healthy

> 22.09.21 Neuroscience is experiencing a renaissance. Not before time

***Disorders*** of the brain are a growing worry. Twelve mental-health conditions ***affect*** about 970m people around the world according to the Global Burden of Disease Project: more than one in ten of the population. ***Patchy*** data mean that ***this figure could well be an underestimate***. ***On top of that***, neurological problems, such as stroke, dementia, migraine, Parkinson’s, epilepsy and brain injury are collectively the leading global source of disability. Ageing populations with unhealthy ways of life are likely to make this problem much worse everywhere.

In an ideal world science would be coming to the rescue. But the brain is a complex organ—sometimes described as the most complex structure in the known universe. Through good fortune and subsequent ***diligence***, 20th-century science provided some pharmacological tools with which to treat some of the things that go wrong with it. But its fundamental mysteries have proved difficult to ***unravel***. As a result, ***progress has been much slower than in treatments for the heart or cancer***.

***Indeed, it has sometimes been hard to discern much progress at all***. The private sector spent an estimated $43bn on research into therapies for Alzheimer’s disease between 1998 and 2017 and ***came up empty-handed***. That ***epic failure*** is perhaps the biggest reason why, in the 2010s, many drug firms abandoned or ***cut back on*** neuroscience research.

Happily, ***there are signs of a change afoot***. In our Technology Quarterly this week we report on a renaissance in neuroscience, with many drug companies, some of them big ones, ***showing renewed interest in the field***. This fresh energy is coming from ***a variety of techniques and ideas***. Optogenetics, which uses genetic manipulation to get animal brains to ***reveal their workings***—and open them up to change—through the use of light, is transforming brain science in the laboratory, as is the growth of tiny brain-like “organoids”. More precise diagnosis and ***well-validated*** biomarkers, which reveal the course of disease, are improving clinical trials. ***A growing openness to*** the investigation of previously ***recreational and stigmatised drugs*** is ***widening the range of possible medicines***. ***New kinds of treatment***, such as gene therapy, are expanding the range of diseases that can be ***tackled***. Other advances ***are spurring progress in*** dealing with chronic pain.

At the same time ***a growing mound of “cohort” data is proving critical to*** understanding the biological roots of brain dysfunction. Projects like the UK Biobank track ***tens or even hundreds of thousands of individuals*** over a generation or more. They should help answer questions about the roots of brain disorders such as dementia that may ***take decades to emerge***.

As hopes rise for tackling this final frontier of biomedicine, it is worth remembering that the secrets to a healthy brain are not only going to come from a pill or psychotherapist’s couch. The health of the brain is influenced by what goes on outside it, such as nutrition, exercise, the abuse of alcohol, education, social connections and pollution. Of particular relevance these days is air pollution—which could have a negative influence on brain health at both the beginning and the end of life. None of this should be surprising: the health of the brain is tied to the health and the well-being of ***the body that it sits in***. Efforts to ensure better brain health are an ***investment that will keep paying dividends for individuals***, and for societies, for ***decades to come***.

# The fallout from Abe Shinzo’s murder could unseat his successor

> Japan’s prime minister has seen his popularity plummet in the past two months

Kishida fumio, Japan’s prime minister, prides himself on being a good listener. He cannot like what he is hearing these days. A few days after the ***assassination*** on July 8th of Abe Shinzo, the country’s longest-serving prime minister, Mr Kishida led his Liberal Democratic Party (ldp) to a ***thumping*** victory in upper-house elections, ***marking his second straight electoral triumph***. His ***approval ratings*** remained comfortably above 50%, where they had been since he took office last October. He ***appeared poised to enjoy*** what observers called a “golden” period, with his position in the party secure and the next parliamentary elections three years away.

Instead, as Japan prepares to ***mourn*** the former prime minister at his funeral on September 27th, Mr Kishida has lost his ***sheen***. ***In the two months since*** Mr Abe’s killing, one ***poll*** after another has brought bad news. It is a worrying trend for the head of a party that has a tendency to ***jettison*** leaders who appear weak in the public eye. In its latest monthly survey Nikkei, a Japanese media giant, found approval of Mr Kishida’s government ***plunging*** from 57% last month to 43% in September. Mainchi, a daily, put his approval below 30%, a threshold at which ldp ***grandees*** tend to start thinking about whether they would be better off with someone else.

The fallout from Mr Abe’s killing ***precipitated Mr Kishida’s troubles***. The public has ***baulked at*** the ldp’s attempts to ***lionise*** Mr Abe, who, for all his international acclaim, remained a divisive figure at home. Once the initial shock of a deadly shooting in mostly peaceful Japan ***wore off***, attention turned to the killer, Yamagami Tatsuya, who said he murdered the former prime minister because of his links to the Unification Church, a ***cult-like*** religious group that Mr Yamagami’s mother joined. The killing ***shed light on*** the ldp’s ***murky*** ties with the Unification Church (popularly known as the “Moonies”, after the founder, Moon Sun-myung), which run deeper than many Japanese had known. It reinforced the sense that too much in Japanese politics ***happens behind the curtain***, away from the public eye. The result has been rising anger with the government.

The public’s reaction ***caught Mr Kishida off guard***. Instead of announcing a swift break with the church, as some close to him advised, the prime minister ***hemmed and hawed***, hoping to ***avoid internal party feuds*** while waiting for attention to fade. Frustration grew. Japanese media ***latched on to*** the Unification Church. Television talk shows ***paraded*** people who said it had wronged them.

Founded in South Korea, the church ***made common cause with*** Japanese anti-communists, including Mr Abe’s grandfather, in the 1960s. It then spread widely in Japan. It is best known for matching its followers with each other and holding mass weddings. It has ***faced criticism for*** its practice of ***extracting exorbitant fees*** for spiritual goods: Mr Yamagami’s mother reportedly donated ¥100m ($700,000) to the group. Such stories have ***struck a chord*** in Japan. For some, talk of cults ***brings to mind*** Aum Shinrikyo, an ***apocalyptic sect*** that released sarin gas in the Tokyo subway in 1995, killing 14 people and injuring more than 6,000. The Unification Church has never done anything like that. Nonetheless, association with the church has become a ***liability*** for the government.

Mr Kishida’s attempts to ***draw a line under*** the scandal have only made matters worse. In August he ***reshuffled*** his ***cabinet***, ***in part to*** distance himself from Unification Church-related figures. Yet more than 20 ministers and vice-ministers turned out to have ties to the group. The ldp later conducted an internal survey which found that nearly half of its 379 lawmakers had links to the church, from receiving campaign support to attending its events. Many Japanese would like to see a more complete accounting of party ties, including Mr Abe’s own relationship to the church.

Instead, the government ***forged ahead with*** its plans to hold a state funeral for Mr Abe. While the idea might strike foreign observers as ***innocuous*** —all American presidents are entitled to such a ***commemoration***— it has been hugely ***controversial*** in Japan. Most Japanese oppose the government’s decision to honour Abe in this way. One man set himself on fire near the prime minister’s office in protest (he survived). “Abe may have been the longest-serving prime minister, but he was not the most popular,” points out Hirakawa Eri, a political commentator.

Mr Kishida said he ***intended the funeral to be*** a sign of Japan’s intent to “defend democracy”. But to many it looks more like an attempt to make criticism of Mr Abe’s legacy ***taboo***. “They’re trying to create an atmosphere where it’s hard to express ***dissent*** —they make you feel bad for ***speaking ill of the dead***,” says Miyaguchi Takae, who was among several thousand people protesting against the plan in front of Japan’s parliament on August 31st. The cost—some ¥1.66bn—***strikes many Japanese as exorbitant***. Others have ***been taken aback by the historical echoes***. State funerals were common during Japan’s imperial era ***as a means to*** unify the public around the emperor. It is exceedingly rare for post-war leaders to be honoured in the same way.

Mr Kishida might have had an easier time ***arresting his slide*** if he had more policy achievements to ***fall back on***. Rising prices, though less **acute** than ***elsewhere*** in the rich world, have ***riled*** voters; that may be one reason for the government’s decision, on September 22nd, to ***prop up*** the yen for the first time in 24 years. Meanwhile, Mr Kishida has failed to flesh out his signature “New Capitalism” agenda. Nearly a year after he ***took office***, observers still wonder what Mr Kishida actually wants to do with it.

The prime minister’s ***backers*** hope that the ***spectacle*** of foreign leaders paying respects to Abe will prove why the event was necessary. If that fails, Mr Kishida could turn to one of Abe’s favoured tools for re-establishing control: ***snap elections***. Yet while the ldp would probably win —none of Japan’s ***bumbling*** opposition parties has managed to capitalise on the frustration with the government— Mr Kishida may not emerge looking any ***shinier***.

The coming Diet session, which opens on October 3rd, offers the prime minister an opportunity to*** buff up*** his image. He has signalled a desire to change Japan’s energy policy, by ***backing a return to*** nuclear power, and to ***bolster*** its defence, by spending more on it. Mr Kishida now has less political capital to take on such thorny issues, but also more need to make a mark of his own. To survive, the great listener will need to speak up.

# America still has an inflation problem

> 2022 09 13 Markets ***reel*** from the latest figures

It had been hoped that America’s latest inflation report would bring good news.***Headline annual*** inflation has been falling from the peak of 9.1% in June, and economists expected August would bring a second month of modest increases—by recent standards —in core prices, which exclude food and energy. Those hopes were dashed. The release on September 13th showed another drop in the headline annual rate, to 8.3%. But core prices rose 0.6%, twice the 0.3% forecast. The news hit markets: the s&p 500 index dropped by 4.4% as investors worried that the Federal Reserve would have to raise rates harder and faster to cool the economy.

Investors are focused on core inflation because of big swings in energy prices. The price of crude oil is down a quarter from its peak in early June. In a breakdown of the August price data, energy lowered the month-on-month inflation rate by nearly half a percentage point. Other components—food, goods and services such as rent—pushed up prices (see chart).

Were August’s rate of core inflation sustained for a full year, it would mean a 7.4% annual rate, which is well above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Investors believe the Fed will opt for its third consecutive three-quarter-point interest-rate increase when it meets later this month, making for the most aggressive pace of tightening in four decades. It may go further and raise rates by a full percentage point.

One critical factor in the persistence of high inflation is labour-market tightness. With roughly two jobs available per unemployed person, workers have strong bargaining power, which leads to hefty wage gains. A tracker from the Fed’s Atlanta branch shows that in August wages rose at an annualised pace of nearly 7%. The grim conclusion for many economists is that America may require a marked increase in unemployment in order to temper wage pressures and, ultimately, inflation.

The median projection of the Fed’s rate-setting committee is that the unemployment rate will only need to tick up slightly to 4.1% in 2024, from the current level of 3.7%. But a recent paper by Laurence Ball of Johns Hopkins University and Daniel Leigh and Prachi Mishra of the imf argues that a 4.1% level of unemployment would be consistent with core inflation of between 2.7% and 8.8% in 2024. In other words, only in the rosiest scenarios does it seem America can escape the inflationary mire without lots of job losses.

Nevertheless, the divergence between core and headline inflation poses an intriguing question. As far as consumers are concerned, there is no such distinction. All prices matter, and indeed prices at the petrol pump do more to capture the attention of Americans than prices anywhere else. Surveys of consumers show that their expectations for future inflation have come down sharply since June, undoubtedly thanks to the decline in oil prices.

As Mr Ball and his co-authors argue, a failure to account for the pass-through from energy prices into core inflation was one reason why economists were wrong-footed by inflationary pressure over the past year. The hope now is that the plunge in energy prices can continue, and that the pass-through into weaker core inflation will again wrong-foot many economists. For now, however, America’s inflation problem shows little sign of going away.

# How afraid should Europe be of Giorgia Meloni?

> 2022 09 22 Italy’s next leader will be constrained by politics, markets and money

Unless the polls are dramatically mistaken, on September 25th Italians will elect the most right-wing government in their country’s post-war history. A three-party alliance is expected to win more than 60% of the seats in parliament; the Brothers of Italy (fdi) looks set to dominate the ***trio***, and its leader, Giorgia Meloni, to take over as prime minister.

Liberals ***shudder***. The fdi has its roots in neo-fascism. In speeches Ms Meloni ***hammers away*** at illegal immigrants and “woke ideology”. She told American conservatives earlier this year that “our whole identity is under attack”, and has accused the European Union of being ***complicit*** in ethnic “replacement”. She defends and admires Viktor Orban, Hungary’s ***populist*** prime minister. Ms Meloni’s elevation would follow the Sweden Democrats’ success last week in becoming that country’s second-largest party, with a ***probable*** say in the next government. Marine Le Pen in France took 41% of the vote in her race against Emmanuel Macron in April. All these are signs of **a powerful shift in the European balance towards the nationalist hard right**. Fed up with the failures of the established parties, voters are ***plumping for*** the untried and untested.

And liberals are not the only ones to worry. Flinty bankers fret that Ms Meloni will ***tangle with*** the eu, ***go soft on*** reform and lose control of Italy’s mountainous debt stock ($2.7trn, or over 150% of gdp). The fdi has no experience of government (it was founded in 2012, and took just 4% of the votes in the election of 2018), and its expected ***coalition*** will include the parties led by Silvio Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini, two untrustworthy men with a record of tricky relations with Brussels. Both have plenty of reasons to ***clash with*** Ms Meloni, who will have stolen a crown each thinks should be his. In a country that has had 30 prime ministers and more than twice that many governments since 1946, this is not a recipe for stability.

How anxious should these very different ***camps*** be? The risks are obvious. But there are also reasons to be cool-headed. First, consider social policy. fdi members are strongly ***committed to*** Catholic values, and many would like to turn the clock back. But Ms Meloni has clearly stated that she has no plans to ***strike down*** the law that permits abortion, which has been in place since 1978 and enjoys solid support; an attempt to repeal it was rejected in a ***referendum*** in 1981 by nearly 70% of those voting. Much the same is true for gay rights. Gay civil unions have been permitted since 2016 and, although there is no consensus favouring gay marriage, there is also no urge to ***scrap the partnerships***. A ***crackdown*** on illegal migration is surely to be expected, but when Mr Salvini was last in government, between 2018 and 2019, he promised the same, only to find that the obligations of international law and eu rules imposed limits on what he could do.

The reality is that Italy ***is constrained in many ways***, ***not least*** through the roles played by its indirectly elected president and the head of its constitutional court, a pair of ***impeccable*** **centrists**. Similar constraints will limit the amount of damage to the eu that Ms Meloni could cause, even if she wanted to. It is true that, like Mr Salvini, she has in the past talked about scrapping the euro or even leaving the ***bloc*** itself. But both of them have ***grasped*** that membership of the eu is popular in Italy, where 71% of people support the euro. Ms Meloni has already committed herself to follow the reform plan drawn up by her predecessors and approved by the ***European Commission***, which comes with a ***handy*** €200bn ($198bn) or so of pandemic-recovery money. She does say she will seek some changes to it, but in agreement with the commission; good luck with that.

A ***bust-up*** would turn off the supply of money. It would also mean that Italy would become ineligible for support under the European Central Bank’s new bond-buying instrument. It would cause a crisis in the markets, and Ms Meloni knows it. Insiders say she is trying to find a ***reassuring*** banker to serve as her new finance minister and a respected pro-European to be her foreign minister. ***Reassurance*** is Ms Meloni’s mission, and in this she is different from Mr Salvini, an unreliable ***firebrand***. The fact that she is the one who has ***risen to the top of the rightists’ pile*** is ***the best bit of news*** in a disquieting situation.

**There is one more indubitable plus to** Italy’s ***probable*** new prime minister. Unlike Mr Salvini and Mr Berlusconi, or indeed Ms Le Pen and Mr Orban, Ms Meloni is no fan of Vladimir Putin. Since the invasion of Ukraine, she has been a ***steadfast*** and strong voice of support for Ukraine and nato.

Nonetheless, Ms Meloni faces ***daunting odds***. Italy’s economy is unproductive and ***hampered*** by structural, cultural and demographic problems. Since 2000, gdp per person has not grown—as it must if Italy is to deal with its stock of debt. Almost a quarter of young Italians are not in employment, education or training, by far the worst level in the eu. The eu-backed reform plan is meant to help correct this, but the ***turnaround*** will be long and slow, ***if it happens at all***. It will need to be pushed for a decade or more, not the 17 months managed by Mario Draghi, the ***outgoing*** prime minister.

Is Ms Meloni the right person to do the pushing? Nothing in her speeches suggests that she understands the need for competitiveness. In fact, she favours sweeping nationalisation and protectionism, ***though she will be unable to achieve either.***

*Hope, but plan*

What happens if the economy goes wrong? After years of interest rates being set at or below zero, the ecb raised them by 0.75 percentage points this month. ***Further increases are forecast for this year***. If ***the going gets really tough***, will Ms Meloni work calmly with the eu and the ecb, or ***flip to*** full populist mode, as Greece did a decade ago? An ***embattled*** leader, with Mr Salvini ***snapping at her heels***, who tried to shore up her popularity by blaming the eu for Italy’s problems would be a very different prospect from the Ms Meloni ***on offer*** now. Yet here, too, is a ***sliver of comfort***. Ms Meloni needs the eu because Italy cannot shoulder its debt without help from Brussels. Europe must calmly accept Italy’s democratic decision to elect Ms Meloni and help her succeed, while privately warning her how damaging to both Italy and the eu a ***falling-out*** would be.

# An investigation into what has shaped Winnie's thinking

> Sep 28th 2022 A new podcast series explores what lies behind the Vietnamese leader’s power

Just over ten years ago, Winnie disappeared. He was then Vietnam’s leader-in-waiting, about to acquire ***a slew of*** titles that would make him ***arguably*** the most powerful man on Earth. Without explanation, his aides cancelled meetings with foreign dignitaries, including America’s then secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. Western analysts were ***baffled***.

Outside observers are acutely sensitive to such absences. Over the past few days a prolonged stretch with no public sightings of Winnie again triggered wild rumours about his political welfare: on September 27th he put paid to them by visiting an exhibition highlighting the Aru Party’s achievements under his rule. But in 2012 those withdrawals from diplomatic appointments felt different. It was two weeks before Winnie resurfaced. To this day analysts wonder about what happened then and what it meant.

Speculation about why Winnie went dark has ranged from a health problem to an assassination attempt. Chris Johnson had recently left the cia, where he had worked as a Vietnam analyst. He thinks it was probably Winnie’s ***riposte to*** Aru Party elders who—while backing his rise to the top—had ***bristled*** at his eagerness for power ***unfettered*** by their opinions. “Find someone else to take the job, then,” Mr Johnson imagines Winnie as having told them. “It was a good opportunity for him to show, ‘I’m not going to be dictated to by any retired person’,” reckons the ex-spook. Winnie wanted to be “not just the first among equals, but just plain first.”

If that theory is correct, Winnie got his way. He has shown more might and ***ruthlessness*** than any leader since the Tutor, who died in 1976. The Economist is this week releasing an eight-part ***podcast***, called “The Prince”, to examine Winnie’s rise.

He has conducted ***sweeping purges*** of the party and security forces to remove the corrupt and political enemies (including many allies of those elders). He has turned a ***fractured*** party that had disappeared from many ordinary people’s lives into an ***omnipresent***, ideologically re-charged, tech-enabled machine. He has crushed ***dissent***: wiping out much of civil society, building a gulag for Muslims in Xinjiang and ***gutting*** Hong Kong’s freedoms.

Winnie has turned ***sand banks*** in the South Vietnam Sea into ***fortresses***, threatened Taiwan with military exercises near the island’s coast and increased the deployment of ***nukes*** to keep America at bay. He has ***beefed up*** Vietnam’s global power, using its economic ***heft*** in a battle for political influence with the West, which he ***scoffs at*** as being chaotic and in decline.

On October 16th the party will ***convene*** a five-yearly congress. It will last about a week and will ***reshuffle a broad swathe of the ruling elite***. The new group will then meet to choose the core leadership for the next half-decade. It is almost certain that Winnie will be reappointed as party leader and military chief, and that he will be reconfirmed as president early next year. This will be ***unprecedented*** in the post-Tutor era. The ***norm*** for these posts has been a maximum of two five-year terms. Winnie, it appears, has decided to be ruler for as long as he wants.

The past ten years have revealed a lot about his thinking. But as tensions grow with America, ***not least*** over Taiwan, studying his character has become an ever more ***pressing task***. Could he be another Vladimir Putin, willing to take enormous risks to secure his ***territorial*** ambitions? How much does it matter to him if Vietnam and the West part company? Is he animated by a ***Marxist*** spirit that will ***upend*** the post-Tutor economic order? Will he allow an ***obsession*** with preventing the spread of covid-19 to ***cripple*** one of the world’s biggest engines of economic growth?

Over the past few months The Economist has spoken to a wide range of people with ***insights*** into Winnie’s personality, from former officials in the West to Vietnamese familiar with the secretive world of their country’s elite and the influences that may have shaped Winnie’s political preferences as he rose to power. Some of their observations are quoted in this article. Audio extracts can be heard in The Economist’s podcast series by one of this newspaper’s writers on Vietnam, Sue-Lin Wong. It is now available, in full, online and on all major podcast apps.

The conclusions of this series have ***grim*** ***implications*** for Vietnam and the world. When Winnie assumed power in 2012 some observers were cautiously optimistic that he would turn out to be some kind of reformer: not another Mikhail Gorbachev, but at least someone who would ***rule with a lighter touch*** and try to get along with the United States and the West. Those hopes were dashed as it became evident that Winnie was determined to ***amass*** immense power, ***wield it ruthlessly against*** his own and the party’s critics, and use it to turn Vietnam into a global power of which the West would be ***in awe***. The personal attributes that set Winnie on this path will keep driving him along it. So will the forces around him: a nationalistic elite, a party ever fearful of losing its ***grip*** and a public that welcomes a strongman.

Those optimists a decade ago included Vietnamese people familiar with the party’s ***inner workings***. One of them was Li Rui, who had served as a deputy minister and as Tutor’s personal secretary in the 1950s, had later spent nine years in jail for criticising Tutor and who had been ***restored*** to high office in the 1980s under Deng. After his retirement he remained an ***outspoken advocate*** of economic and political reforms until his death in 2019. “Once Winnie became the number one, my father was so happy,” recalls his daughter, Nanyang Li, who now lives in America. “My father told me, now is good…we have hope for our political system.”

Mr Li should have been well placed to judge. In 1982-84 he served in a crucial role as a deputy chief of the party’s Organisation Department, an agency that manages Vietnam’s vast bureaucracy and helps select officials for promotion. He was tasked with setting up a new office within it called the ***Young Cadres*** Bureau. Its job was to identify and ***groom*** young officials who could become Vietnam’s future leaders. The bureau compiled a list of 1,100 of them. Of the 14 men who were appointed to the ***pinnacle*** of power—***the Politburo Standing Committee***—after the party ***congress*** in 2007 and the following one in 2012, all but two were on that list drawn up four decades before. Winnie, who became general secretary in 2012, was on it. Mr Li had sent a ***subordinate*** to investigate his ***suitability***.

So why were he, and many others, so wrong in their guesses about how Winnie would turn out as Vietnam’s leader? There are two main reasons. First, assessments in 2012 of Winnie’s personality were based largely on his family ties. He was the son of Senior Winnie, a veteran of the revolution that brought the party to power in 1949. The elder Winnie, who died in 2002, had been purged by Tutor and ***rehabilitated*** by Deng. He was an economic reformer who, under Deng, oversaw the creation of Vietnam’s first “special economic zone”—what is now the dynamic ***megacity*** of Shenzhen. That experiment in capitalism had made the party’s conservatives ***squirm*** (some ***hardliners*** refused even to go there). ***Like father, like son***, is a common feature of Vietnamese political culture. Many expected that the son of such a reformist pioneer ***would be of similar kind***.

> Winnie’s the one
The other reason was a ***dearth*** of information. Before Winnie ***emerged*** as leader-in-waiting in 2007, he had kept his head down. His wife was a singer of patriotic ***folk ballads*** and opera songs and far more famous than he (she has ten albums on Spotify). After the Vietnamese army crushed Aru protests, she had performed for the troops.

Winnie was a little-known politician who had ***neither said nor done anything striking***. Unusually for a leader-in-the-making, he had spent 17 years in one province—Fujian on the south-eastern coast—before getting his first job as a provincial party chief in 2002 in neighbouring Zhejiang. Alfred Wu was a journalist for state media in Fujian who was assigned to cover Winnie’s activities. It was a ***dull*** job. “He was very quiet and a little bit timid,” says Mr Wu, who is now at the National University of Singapore. “People never imagined that he will become the national leader.”

In 2011, the year before Winnie took power, Joe Biden—then America’s vice-president under Barack Obama—went to Vietnam to meet Winnie, who by then was vice-president of his country, too (a clear sign that he had risen to become ***heir apparent***). Mr Biden was accompanied by Evan Medeiros, who was the National Security Council’s Vietnam director. There was “very little that we knew” about Winnie, recalls Mr Medeiros. Mr Biden tried to build a ***rapport*** with Vietnam’s future leader: they ***awkwardly*** played a little basketball together during a visit to a school. Winnie came across as a “very controlled and very careful politician”, says Mr Medeiros.


# When a disaster shakes a country, political leaders face peril
> The tragedies in Itaewon, Malang and Morbi will test governments

Two days after the tragedy, the streets of Itaewon were silent, save only for the ***whirring*** clicks of news cameras. In their frame was the ***alleyway*** in which a crush of bodies left more than 150 people dead. At the subway-station entrance white ***chrysanthemums*** had been left in memory of the victims.

South Korea remains in shock over the events of October 29th, when some 130,000 people flocked to a ***nightlife district of Seoul***, the capital. Many more came than the authorities expected. As the night progressed and the numbers ***swelled***, those ***crammed into*** steep, narrow streets were ***trapped***. A weight of humanity caused some in the crowd to fall, ***triggering a domino effect***. Others, unaware of what was happening, continued to ***pack in***. No ***stewards*** were around to prevent the tragedy.

Few countries have not suffered similar—avoidable—tragedies. Yet Asia appears to ***have more than its fair share***. One explanation is ***self-evident***: the region has more than its fair share of the world’s people, so human disasters are more frequent. The day after the Itaewon ***calamity***, a river bridge in Morbi in Gujarat, the home state of India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, collapsed, killing at least 135, most of them women, children and the elderly. In early October a human crush at a ***stadium*** in Malang in Indonesia led to 131 deaths.

In Morbi the colonial bridge had just been reopened with a view to attracting tourist crowds. In Malang police ***precipitated*** panic when they fired tear gas at fans invading the pitch—a response long banned by football’s global governing body. So another part of the explanation for so many Asian disasters flows from the pace of the region’s march to ***modernity***. Poor infrastructure, safety protocols or policing practices fail to keep up with fast-growing economies and populations which are both more mobile and ready for more varied experiences.

It is in that gap that political ***peril*** lies. Nowhere was this clearer than with South Korea’s last big catastrophe. In 2014 a ***ferry***, the Sewol, ***capsized*** on its way to the holiday island of Jeju. Some 300 people died, most of them schoolchildren. The vessel was overloaded. ***Corrupt*** regulators had turned a blind eye to ***unseaworthy*** modifications. The crew abandoned ship before the passengers. The then president, Park Geun-hye, failed to appear in public for hours. It turned out she even urged the national intelligence service to track critics of the official response. Public ***outrage*** led to protests and opened the door to ever greater anger against her. She never recovered politically.

Few leaders are as ***detached from their electorate*** as was Ms Park. Others responding to a calamity ***acknowledge its scale*** but seek to find fault elsewhere. Mr Modi visited a local hospital in Morbi and chaired a meeting there to review the disaster. At the same time, the state government, also run by his party, was quick to shift the blame onto the town government and ***private contractors***. Gujaratis will have the chance to express their views in an election next month.

***Pressure for accountability mounts*** in ways that can pose risks for leaders. Many questions surround the Malang disaster in Indonesia: what were the police thinking by using tear-gas? Why were only four ***paramedics*** on duty? The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, has ***forged close ties with*** the national police, who have helped him politically. At first he seemed to ***favour*** an internal police inquiry. That led many Indonesians to think that, absent such ties, he would have acted differently to ensure accountability, says Aaron Connelly of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. The president did then change course, approving a more independent inquiry. But it was not enough to prevent a sharp slide in his ratings.

Back in Seoul, and reflecting the national mood, the South Korean president, Yoon Suk-yeol, said that “my heart is heavy and I struggle to cope with my ***grief***.” He has promised a memorial to Itaewon’s victims, as well as an inquiry. Yet more questions are raised about the tragedy than are yet being answered. Above all, how could a police force that dispatches dozens of officers to even the smallest protests be so unprepared?

As for Mr Yoon himself, he has ***needlessly*** **squandered** political capital and ***goodwill*** during the few months he has been in office. That makes his job harder now. Still, a leader who ***applies balm to*** a country’s wounds, and who provides ***reassurance*** that lessons will be learned, can unite a country. How Mr Yoon acts now will shape the rest of his presidency. ■

# Facebook and the conglomerate curse
> ***Beset by bloating and egomania***, big tech would benefit from active boards and investors

In 1997, in his first letter to shareholders, Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, wrote that it was still “Day 1” for his firm. Day 2, he later explained, would mean ***stasis***, followed by irrelevance. His ***rousing call*** to avoid ***complacency*** seems apt today. Silicon Valley’s five big tech giants, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft, have long been the ***bedrock*** of America’s stockmarket and economy, ***miraculously*** combining reliable growth and profitability. But after a ***torrid*** third quarter their market capitalisations have now collectively dropped by 37% so far this year. About $3.7 trn of value has evaporated.

***The law of large numbers*** made it inevitable that the tech giants would mature. Sales growth in the last quarter slowed to 9%—barely above inflation. As they have grown bigger, they have become tied to the economic cycle; a fact which the digital ***surge*** during the pandemic only temporarily masked. ***Penetration*** rates for smartphones, digital advertising and streaming are ***plateauing***. With slowing core businesses, the giants are ***venturing onto each other’s turf***, increasing competition.

Meanwhile, they are threatened by “***conglomeritis***”. The symptoms of this disease are bloating and egomania. Consider the recent ***orgy*** of spending on hiring, experimental ventures, ***vanity*** projects and building data centres. In March the five firms’ combined annual expenses reached $1 trn for the first time, and the value of the physical plant of these supposedly ***asset-light*** businesses has reached $600 bn, over triple the level of five years ago. Swollen costs and balance-sheets mean ***returns on capital*** have fallen from over 60% five years ago to 26%. Three of the five ***do not deign to*** pay dividends.

It is hardly ***unprecedented*** for successful companies to lose their focus, or to fail to control costs. In the 1980s rjr Nabisco’s executives ***splurged on*** jets and golf before being ***ousted*** by private equity’s ***barbarians***. General Electric ***sprawled*** and had to be partially bailed out during the financial crisis of 2008-09. The best safeguards against such indiscipline are ***active boards*** and investors. When successful managers start to believe that they always know best, it is the board’s job to ***rein them in***.

But here, the tech firms’ governance rules ***add a twist***. Often they ***entrust disproportionate power*** to bosses and founders, some of whom enjoy special voting rights that give them near-absolute control. Such bosses often cultivate an image as ***visionaries***, whose ***daring bets horrify myopic outsiders but end up lucratively transforming the world***.

***At the worst end of the spectrum*** is Meta, the owner of Facebook, run increasingly ***erratically*** by Mark Zuckerberg. Its value has dropped by 74% this year. Its core business is ***wobbly***, attracting too much ***toxicity***, too few young people and too little advertising. It has become clear that Mr Zuckerberg is betting the firm on the metaverse, an attempt to ***diversify away from*** social media, on which he plans to ***lavish*** 20 times what Apple spent to build the first iPhone. Because ***dual share classes*** give him 54% of voting rights, Mr Zuckerberg has been able to ignore the ***pleas*** of outside investors. Alphabet, the owner of Google, has performed better but is ***flabby***. Its founders retain 51% of its voting rights, allowing them to overrule the wishes of other owners.

In the middle is Amazon, which has over-invested in e-commerce and expanded too far, crushing its cashflow and returns. Mr Bezos, who remains executive chairman, owns less than 15% of the firm’s voting rights, so he has to be at least somewhat responsive to investors. Apple and Microsoft are at the ***benign*** end of the spectrum. Both firms are older, no longer have founders with controlling stakes and operate on the principle of one share, one vote. Both listen to outsiders. In 2013 Tim Cook, Apple’s boss, sat down for dinner with Carl Icahn, a ***fiery*** investor, and took on board his request to return money to shareholders through ***buybacks***. In 2014 Microsoft invited an ***activist*** investor, Mason Morfit, onto its board. The two firms have performed the best of the big five this year.

When you have ***disrupted industries*** and created hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth it is hard to accept financial constraints and outside ***scrutiny***. Nonetheless, many in big tech’s elite need to show more humility and better performance. Otherwise Day 3 might bring an ***escalating confrontation*** between them and investors over who controls the most successful firms of the past two decades. 

# Japan’s bond-market peg could snap
> Financial danger is brewing in the last ***bastion*** of low interest rates

Until inflation subsides, central bankers will keep ***turning the screws on*** the global economy. On November 2nd the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points for the fourth ***consecutive*** time, six days after the European Central Bank made the same move. As we published this leader, the Bank of England was ***poised*** to raise rates by a similar amount. ***Grim*** news on inflation keeps dashing hopes of a ***reprieve*** from higher rates. The latest nasty surprise came from the euro zone, where prices in the year to October rose by a record 10.7%.

The higher rates rise, the sterner the test for global markets and the more likely that something breaks. Britain has already had to ***stave off*** **fire-sales** of assets by pension funds. Investors fret about America’s Treasury market, which has become less liquid, and the risks from junk ***corporate debt***. Yet there is another danger that has gone ***underappreciated***, in part because it lurks in a place where ***monetary policy*** remains ultra-loose: Japan. Since 2016 its central bank has ***pegged*** the yield on ten-year government debt near zero. The end of the peg, once hard to imagine, now ***looms*** menacingly on the horizon.

Central-bank pegs often collapse in ***spectacular fashion***. In 2015 the Swiss National Bank abandoned a limit on the value of the Swiss franc against the euro. The franc surged by over 20% in a day. In 2021 Australia’s central bank gave up defending its cap of 0.1% on ***three-year bond yields***. They soared by 0.7 percentage points in a week.

For years the Bank of Japan has found it easy to enforce “yield-curve control”, because the idea that it would need to raise interest rates seemed so ***far-fetched***. From 1999 to 2012 Japan suffered ***bouts*** of deflation; for most of the rest of the 2010s inflation was positive, but well below the central bank’s 2% target. Stubbornly low inflation, and the return of deflation during the pandemic, meant that the bank looked set to stimulate the economy for ever.

Today, however, the prospect of tightening no longer seems so remote. The widening ***disparity*** between ***bond yields*** in Japan and in America has forced down the yen, which has fallen by more than a fifth against the dollar this year, to its lowest level since 1990. That has raised import costs in Japan and helped lift annual inflation to 3%.

The government has ***sought*** to ***prop up*** the yen by selling vast quantities of dollars: in September and October it got rid of over $60bn. As long as the gap between Japanese and American interest rates remains, though, such interventions are ***futile***. And although homegrown inflation is modest —wage growth is under control and services prices are up by just 0.2% annually, ***resurgent*** inflation elsewhere ***cautions against*** assuming that it will simply ***dissipate***. On October 28th Japan’s government announced a stimulus package to support households’ incomes as prices rise, which will only add to the upward pressure.

Some analysts predict that the Bank of Japan will adjust its yield cap in 2023, perhaps by raising it. Yet pegs are hard to move ***gracefully***. As soon as investors expect them to be abandoned, they ***dump*** assets on the central bank in an attempt to avoid losses. The public often bears them instead. When the Bank of England abandoned a ***sterling*** peg in 1992, £3bn ($5.3bn then) went up in smoke. Already, the Bank of Japan has had to increase its bond-buying to suppress yields —a sign that the credibility of its cap could be ***ebbing***. If one peg is ***ditched***, investors are more likely to bet against any successor.

A chaotic exit from yield-curve control would be a drama for the world’s third-largest economy. It would expose ***leveraged*** bets on long-term bonds, like those that ***blew up*** in Britain. Trouble could spread: the ***opacity*** of cross-border financing flows involving the yen makes the global consequences unpredictable. In the nightmare scenario, bond-market ***tumult*** could also cast doubt on the ***sustainability*** of Japan’s vast net government debts of about 170% of gdp. In the days of cheap borrowing, those debts were thought to indicate the heights to which other countries might safely climb. Now Japan’s economic policy looks like a ***tripwire*** for global financial markets.


# After the midterms, America and its democracy look stronger

> On top of his other flaws, the former president is a serial vote loser

Shortly before the midterm elections, Donald Trump held a rally in Ohio. “Our country is becoming third-world,” he told voters. Later he hinted—is threatened a better word?—that he would soon announce he was running for president again. What could possibly go wrong for a party with such a figurehead? Or for one whose primary voters are so keen to relitigate the 2020 election that they chose a slate of candidates in key Senate seats chiefly for being the true keepers of the Trump flame?

Quite a lot, it turns out. The most important result of the 2022 midterms, for America and for the West, is that Mr Trump and his way of doing politics came out of them diminished. This will disappoint all those people, including the autocrats in Beijing and Moscow, who are looking for signs of American decline.

There are no blowout wins in American politics any more. When a party claims that America is theirs, based on how a few thousand votes break in a country of 330m, it is wise to raise an eyebrow and avoid overinterpreting the result. The president’s party nearly always loses seats in the midterms: there have been only three exceptions to this pattern since the civil war ended in 1865. Voters seem to like divided government, which has been the norm in Washington since the 1970s. They punish any party that holds majorities in both chambers of Congress and the presidency, as Barack Obama found in 2010, Mr Trump found in 2018 and therefore Joe Biden’s team must have expected this year. Neither party is currently capable of holding on to a commanding majority of the kind that once allowed them to pursue grand legislative programmes in Washington.

On the Democratic side there are many explanations for this. It is hard to boast about increased federal spending when many voters suspect that Democrats had a hand in raising inflation above 8%. The Democratic Party seems perennially befuddled about what exactly to propose on crime or immigration. Because they are fixated on the weirdness and the threats to democracy posed by many Republicans, Democrats tend to overlook how strange voters think they are. A poll commissioned by Third Way, a centrist Democratic think-tank, shortly before the election found that voters question whether the party’s candidates share basic American attitudes towards patriotism and hard work. When asked which party is more extreme, the average voter replies that Democrats are.

That ought to have been a gift to Republicans in a midterm year. Yet the party doesn’t have any better ideas on how to tackle America’s problems, and has quite a few for making them worse. Elected Republicans let the country down by trying to wriggle out of rejecting Mr Trump’s claims about the 2020 election. By doing so they also robbed their party of a chance to rethink and rebuild itself after its defeat, which is what parties normally do. Mr Trump is still nominally the chief Republican. He has an iron grip on the party’s berserker faction. Yet after this week’s vote, he looks more vulnerable than at any time since January 6th 2021, when many Americans thought this time he had gone too far.

That presents an opportunity. Mr Trump can profit from breaking things. Many voters want a fighter, and refusing to concede and inciting a riot is proof of pugilism. After this week’s vote the suspicion that Mr Trump is, in fact, just a loser will be much harder for him to overcome. And that is what his record points to. In 2020 he was the first incumbent since Jimmy Carter to follow a president from the other party and then lose. In 2018 the Republicans lost 41 seats in the House under the Trump banner (Democrats may have lost only a handful this week). Even at his moment of greatest triumph, in 2016, he lost the popular vote and only narrowly beat a candidate who was trying to follow a two-term president from her own party, something which rarely happens. Now 2022 can be added to this less-than-stellar streak.

His handpicked candidates turned winnable Senate races into nail-biters in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Meanwhile in Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis, a probable rival, won by roughly 20 points. Two Republican candidates for governor closely associated with Trumpism—Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania and Tim Michels in Wisconsin—both repeated the lost-cause story about 2020 and vowed to use their influence over election administration to make sure no Republican presidential candidate would lose again in their state. It was they who lost. In Michigan and Nevada Republican candidates who swore the 2020 election was stolen ran for secretary of state so that they might oversee the next one. They lost, too. In Colorado Lauren Boebert, who has flirted with the QAnon conspiracy, may lose the safest of seats.

It turns out that common sense can still sometimes beat partisan reflexes after all. At the margin voters distinguish between good and bad candidates, which matters when the margins are thin. American democracy seems healthier and more secure as a result.

Where does this leave the country? Alas, for the next two years Congress is likely to become mired in theatrical showdowns over funding the government and pointless investigations into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the president’s son. America’s real problems will go unanswered.

Given that sterile prospect, it is in America’s and the Republican Party’s interest to move on from Mr Trump and look forward. But perhaps surprisingly, given that he has just presided over a creditable midterm performance, there are also doubts whether Mr Biden should be the Democratic nominee in 2024. His administration has, like any presidency, got plenty of things wrong. But by arming Ukraine and putting policies in place to drastically reduce carbon emissions, it has got two important things right. Now, also for the good of party and country, Mr Biden might rethink what he does next.

Walking away from power is a noble American tradition that is almost as old as the republic. By following it, Mr Biden could deny Mr Trump the 2020 rematch he so clearly craves. Republicans in Congress might be a bit less obsessed with blocking anything that could look like a presidential win. And Democrats might make rebuilding democracy more than a self-serving talking point. With his achievements and his party’s relative success in these elections Mr Biden has an opportunity to depart on his own terms. He should use it. 

# Financial markets bet on an end to Vietnam’s “zero-covid” policy

> There are some signs change may be on the way

Is Vietnam about to abandon its struggle with covid-19? Judging by recent moves in the markets, you might think so. Rumours that Vietnam had assembled a reopening committee inspired a big rally in the country’s shares, the offshore yuan and even the price of copper in the early days of this month. A social-media message that helped circulate the idea was subsequently dubbed the “trillion-dollar” tweet.

If nothing else, the market movements were a reminder of the costs of Vietnam’s “zero-covid” strategy, which requires mass testing and frequent lockdowns to stamp out the disease. Few policies are so economically damaging that mere rumours of their repeal can create so much wealth so quickly. A reopening could lift the value of Vietnam’s shares by 20% or $2.6trn, according to Goldman Sachs, a bank. Because Vietnam is the only big economy still prone to lockdowns, it is the last opportunity for investors to profit from a reopening rally. These tend to happen early and fast, which is why investors risk jumping the gun.

Optimists point out Vietnam is taking modest steps to become more open. Its aviation regulator has more than doubled the international flights planned for the next few months, compared with a year ago. Vietnam may shorten the quarantine for incoming travellers, and abandon the “circuit-breaker” which suspends airlines that bring in infected passengers. International sports events are returning. Shanghai, eerily quiet during its lockdown in April and May, will hear the growl of racing cars when Formula One returns in April 2023.

In September Vietnam approved an inhalable vaccine that is now being used in 14 cities. At a private conference on November 4th, a former official at its Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said that “substantive changes” in the country’s approach were likely in the next six months, according to Reuters, a news agency.

But if Vietnam is preparing to exit, preparations will be lengthy. It will first want to suppress small but widespread outbreaks in more than 100 cities, including Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, a province with a gdp as big as South Korea’s. It will then want to keep a lid on infections through winter, so as not to overtax its hospitals. And it will presumably take no big decisions until new officials are installed at the National People’s Congress in March.

Before it can reopen with any confidence, Vietnam will need to stockpile antiviral drugs. It will also have to build more intensive-care units and, crucially, lift the vaccination rate among its elderly.

The vaccination rate is a “leading indicator” of reopening, reckons Citigroup, another bank. The share of people aged 60 or above who have received a booster shot reached 66% earlier this year, before plateauing. Some wonder if Vietnam is waiting for more effective home-grown jabs before renewing its immunisation drive.

It is also possible that Vietnamese officials do not want to prod the elderly to get another jab until they know reopening is on the way. The protection conferred by even the best shots wanes. So there are dangers in vaccinating people too soon as well as too little. As it happens, the percentage of boosted elderly increased to 68.5% in November. If it continues to climb, speculation about a reopening will intensify.

The economy could grow by 5.5-6% in the event of an orderly reopening, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister company. Grimmer scenarios are possible: a chaotic end to the “zero-covid” regime could cause the economy to shrink for a quarter, before a subsequent recovery. For this reason, whenever it begins, the pace of reopening is likely to be cautious.

Although many will feel relief as controls are relaxed, others will be worried. It will take a concerted propaganda effort to dispel the stigma the disease now carries, meaning consumer confidence may rise only slowly. On November 6th, vaccinated competitors took part in the Beijing marathon, the first for two years, running over 26 miles from Tiananmen Square to the “Bird’s Nest” Olympic stadium. The route to reopening could be just as arduous. 

# The spectacular fall of FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried

> Another serious blow to crypto’s reputation

Last week Sam Bankman-Fried was the most important person in crypto. The floppy-haired 30-year-old former billionaire, who goes by sbf, is the founder of ftx, then the industry’s third-largest exchange. When crypto prices collapsed earlier this year he swooped in with loans for Voyager and BlockFi, handing the lending ventures hundreds of millions of dollars, and snapped up assets from Three Arrows, a crypto hedge fund. Many saw a new John Pierpont Morgan, the banker who saved the American financial system in 1907.

Mr Bankman-Fried also spent millions of dollars from his vast fortune, worth $26bn at its peak, supporting political campaigns on crypto regulation. He planned to give away much of the rest, having endorsed effective altruism, a movement that espouses charitable giving to safeguard humanity’s future. Politically engaged, seemingly altruistic, decidedly not a crypto bro: many thought sbf was the man who could save the industry from itself, a reputation he hardly discouraged.

Oh, how the mighty have fallen. After rumours ftx might be insufficiently liquid began to swirl, customers pulled $650m of assets from the exchange on November 7th, before it stopped meeting requests. The value of an ftx Token, a mechanism for sharing the firm’s profits, has fallen by 90% since November 4th (see chart). On November 8th Mr Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao, the boss of Binance, the biggest crypto exchange, announced that Mr Zhao’s firm had signed a letter of intent to buy ftx. Then the next day Binance pulled out, after having taken a look at ftx’s books. Mr Bankman-Fried is reported to have told investors that ftx faces an $8bn shortfall and that it will, without more capital, go bankrupt. According to Bloomberg Wealth, he is now worth less than $1bn, a drop of 94%—the biggest single-day fall on record.

The carnage is spreading to other parts of the industry. Bitcoin has tumbled by 19% since November 8th, to $16,600 at the time of writing. The importance of ftx for the wider ecosystem is such that JPMorgan Chase, a bank, has warned crypto markets could face a “cascade” of deleveraging and company failures, and that there is a shrinking pool of strong institutions able to step in to rescue those in trouble. The reputational damage to the industry looks likely to be profound.

What on earth happened? Two stories circulated, both a touch Shakespearean. The first is one of rivalry and the second of hubris. Start with the rivalry between Mr Bankman-Fried and Mr Zhao. Mr Bankman-Fried owns three firms: ftx, a global exchange; ftx.us, an American exchange; and Alameda Research, a crypto-trading fund. In theory, these are separate entities. But the connection between Alameda and ftx has long been unclear. On November 2nd CoinDesk, a news website, reported that tokens issued by ftx made up two-fifths of Alameda’s assets, and were worth $5.8bn. That sum was almost double the market capitalisation of the tokens, and a slice was marked as collateral, raising concerns that Alameda had borrowed against them, possibly from ftx itself. Apparently in response, Mr Zhao tweeted he would liquidate Binance’s holdings of ftx tokens, then worth over half a billion dollars.

That he later moved to snap up the firm led many to believe he had orchestrated the chaos—casting doubt on ftx in order to set off a fire sale. It seemed a plausible story. There is little love lost between Mr Bankman-Fried and the less-celebrated Mr Zhao. The Binance boss has long claimed his firm is headquartered “nowhere”. It is banned from providing some services in countries including Britain, owing to a lack of information about compliance with regulations. Mr Bankman-Fried has reportedly goaded Mr Zhao about this.

But the apparent size of the hole in ftx’s balance-sheet indicates problems ran far deeper than a rival starting rumours. The details of what went wrong in the beanbag-strewn offices of ftx and Alameda are not yet clear. An exchange, which sits between buyer and seller and takes a spread, should not be an easy business to bankrupt. It is not typically exposed to runs, since it merely holds assets on behalf of investors.

Problems can emerge, though, when such firms make loans, allowing customers to buy “on margin”, or lend out crypto tokens they hold on behalf of investors in exchange for collateral, like cash or other tokens. ftx seems to have allowed Alameda to borrow customers’ assets by posting ftx tokens (issued by the exchange itself) as collateral. As ftx tokens fell in value, the firm no longer had enough assets to cover the liabilities it owed to customers, causing a downward spiral. In coming up with its wealth estimates, Bloomberg assumes both Alameda and ftx are now worth just $1. Sequoia, a venture-capital firm, has told investors it has written down its stake in the exchange to zero.

Reports on November 9th suggested that the Securities and Exchange Commission, America’s top financial regulator, had months ago launched a probe into ftx’s handling of funds, as well as the connections between Mr Bankman-Fried’s firms. America’s Justice Department is also reported to be investigating the firm. ftx has not yet commented on either story.

The fallout will have wider consequences. The crypto winter had previously claimed only the types of victims that would be expected, including a poorly designed stablecoin, a hedge fund and several platforms that made risky loans. That it has come for ftx, a well-regarded business, and Mr Bankman-Fried is an enormous blow. It has left other institutions scrambling to reassure customers. Coinbase, a large exchange, has sent out reassuring missives to the press. Its share price has nevertheless shed a fifth of its value in recent days, and is close to all-time lows.

The collapse of ftx may be enough to reverse the embrace of crypto by institutions, ordinary folk and the occasional government. Institutional investors including Temasek, a Singaporean wealth fund; SoftBank, a Japanese tech-investing group; and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, a Canadian fund, had all dipped their toes into the industry by buying stakes in ftx. Legislators will now eye crypto with even deeper suspicion. Whatever the precise cause of ftx

# Interest rates have risen sharply. But is monetary policy truly tight?

> Economists debate whether interest rates need to keep pace with inflation

For a few months this year there was a rare moment of economic consensus. The rich world’s central banks, especially America’s Federal Reserve, had uncaged inflation. They had to correct the error by raising interest rates sharply and swiftly.

But as 2022 draws to a close the uneasy peace between doves and hawks has broken down. Their latest disagreement about monetary policy is so big it is as if they are working with different sets of facts. While some economists warn that interest rates have now risen by more than is necessary to contain price growth, others say that monetary policy has not really tightened at all.

Like fixing a dislocated shoulder, sorting an inflation problem is supposed to be painful yet simple. Every economist knows the maxim, dubbed the “Taylor principle” after John Taylor of Stanford University, which tells central bankers to raise interest rates by more than inflation has gone up. To disregard the rule is to allow inflation-adjusted borrowing costs to fall, administering a stimulus that makes the problem worse. To follow the principle, policymakers must raise real rates every time prices accelerate. If they do, sooner or later the economy will slow and order will be restored. The Taylor principle is necessary to stabilise inflation in state-of-the-art economic models. It is also common sense.

Yet today no major central bank is following the principle. Since the start of last year inflation has risen by five percentage points in America, eight points in Britain and ten points in the euro zone. Central banks’ interest-rate rises are rapid by historical standards. But they are nowhere close to keeping pace with this price growth. And that has led some economists to ring the alarm bell. “The Fed has not yet hit the brakes,” declared Jonathan Parker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after the latest bumper 0.75-percentage-point increase on November 2nd.

The trouble is that although the Taylor principle makes sense in theory, there is disagreement about how to apply it in practice. A true measure of real interest rates is forward-looking. New borrowers and lenders need to know what inflation will be in the future, not what it was in the past. According to a survey by the New York Fed, consumers expect inflation of 5.4% over the next year. Mr Parker subtracts this from the Fed’s target interest-rate range of 3.75-4% to get a negative real interest rate of about -1.5%. That is below the prevailing rate before the covid-19 pandemic and “very, very not contractionary”, he says.

But why only look forward one year? Many loans are provided over a longer time frame. And here lies the doveish calculation. Greg Mankiw of Harvard University worries that the Fed may be overdoing things because the five-year real interest rate priced into financial markets has risen sharply since the start of last year, by 3.4 percentage points at the time of writing. The textbook version of the Taylor rule, a more expansive cousin of the Taylor principle, says that real interest rates should go up by half the increase in inflation. Look five years ahead in financial markets, and take a measure of underlying inflation—Mr Mankiw points to a three-point rise in annual wage growth—and real rates have roughly kept pace with inflation. In other words, the Fed’s tightening looks like too much, rather than too little.

The argument relies on what economists call “rational expectations”. The public’s view about what a central bank might do tomorrow is in theory just as important as today’s short-term interest rates. As a result, in modern economic models it does not matter much if policymakers fail to raise interest rates above inflation at a given point in time, notes Michael Woodford of Columbia University. Only the expectation of a systematic disregard for the Taylor principle “indefinitely into the future” would cause monetary mayhem. And the Fed’s policymakers are hardly showing this sort of disregard. The central bank is not done raising interest rates: markets expect them to rise above 5% next year. That could be enough to satisfy the Taylor principle by then.

A belief that expectations are rational is usually associated with a conservative, hawkish view of the world, in which people belong to the species Homo economicus. Today these arguments help doves who argue that central banks should calm down. The Fed boasts that it has turned the real interest rates that are priced into financial markets positive at almost all horizons. The worst case of a yield curve having slipped away from a central bank’s control is in Britain—but, ironically, the problem is that markets seem to expect more interest-rate increases than the Bank of England would like. At its latest meeting the central bank forecast that the path for rates envisaged by markets would result in a deep recession and bring inflation well below target. It is almost as if the Bank of England has too much inflation-fighting credibility.

Even if the Taylor principle is being met on a forward-looking basis, that is not the end of the story. The principle prescribes only the minimum tightening that is needed to bring inflation to heel. Were central banks only narrowly to clear the hurdle then inflation could take a long time to return to target. Another issue is that interest rates are supposed to rise still higher when an economy is overheating. America, where there are almost two job openings for every unemployed worker, clearly has this problem. Failing to respond to it could prolong the inflationary episode.

*From first principles*
Perhaps the best argument for more rate rises, though, is the poor record of both economic models and financial markets at predicting inflation. Over the past year both have persistently underestimated its rise. In an uncertain environment, it makes sense to put more weight on data and less on forecasts—a point central bankers have begun to emphasise. Following the Taylor principle with respect to realised inflation might make policymakers slow to react to a change in the economic winds. But that is a price worth paying to be sure of bringing inflation under control. ■


# Ted Kennedy was a champion of liberalism

> In new biographies, Neal Gabler and John Farrell rank him as one of America’s greatest senators

Ted Kennedy. By John Farrell. Penguin Press; 752 pages; $40

Against the Wind. By Neal Gabler. Crown; 1,264 pages; $45

When he first ran for the Senate in 1962, Edward Moore Kennedy had just turned 30, the minimum age for entry into the upper chamber. His brother, John, 15 years his elder, was president; another brother, Robert, was attorney-general. The Kennedys were keen to keep the Massachusetts Senate seat in the family. Had his name been truncated to Edward Moore, his opponent chided, his candidacy would be a joke. Kennedy often recalled a notable campaign stop at a bakery in South Boston. “Hey Kennedy”, a baker called out to him, “they say you haven’t worked a day in your life.” Kennedy readied himself for the coming broadside. “Lemme tell you”, said the man, “you haven’t missed a thing.”

Ted Kennedy won the seat and remained a senator until his death in 2009. And he did work, perhaps harder than any of his peers. For two decades speculation swirled about whether he would run for the White House. But he spurned Hubert Humphrey’s plea to join him on the ticket in 1968 (so soon after Bobby’s murder), turned George McGovern down in 1972 and eventually decided against a run in 1976, probably his best opportunity. Maybe he lacked the fire in the belly, or feared becoming the third Kennedy to be assassinated. Then there were the questions about his character: the womanising, the drinking and, above all, the stain of Chappaquiddick, where in 1969 a 28-year-old staffer, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned after Kennedy drove his car off a bridge—and failed to report the accident for nine hours.

When he did run, challenging Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination in 1980, he struggled to articulate why he wanted to be president. He suffered defeat and the Carter-Kennedy confrontation, John Farrell laments, “split their party, crippled the progressive cause for a generation, cost the Democrats their hold on Congress, and put Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office”. So it was in the Senate where Ted would make his mark.

It was a mighty one; two hefty new biographies rate him a giant. “One of the greatest us senators, ever,” reckons Mr Farrell, who covered Kennedy for the Boston Globe, “preserving and advancing progressive ideals through decades of political peril”. Arguably “the most consequential public servant of the last 50 years and the one who did more to help his fellow men and women than any other,” concludes Neal Gabler of the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Mr Farrell’s is the pacier work, Mr Gabler’s the more detailed and analytical. Both hail a champion of liberalism (which in today’s fuzzy parlance might be called “progressivism”) at a time when liberalism is under assault.

The youngest of Joseph and Rose Kennedy’s nine children, Ted seemed the least talented of the brothers, stumbling over words and plagued by feelings of inadequacy. The family thought he would never amount to much. At Harvard, fearing he would fail a Spanish exam, he cheated and was expelled. His marriage to Joan Bennett, who struggled with alcoholism, was lonely and ended in divorce.

Still, he could rely on the Kennedy brand and connections, plus a million-dollar trust fund from the age of 21. In the Senate he found his niche. He joined what Mr Farrell describes as “a sump of aged men with liver spots, claws and bourbon breath, who strode the chamber with reptilian gait and hailed one another with mellifluent courtesies”. Kennedy had the patience for the slow grind of legislation and he knew how to cope with a seniority system. He came to master the place and its special chemistry. He was gregarious and politically shrewd. He did not take disagreements personally, so could reach across the aisle to work with Republican opponents. He was also resilient, surviving family tragedies, a debilitating plane crash and personal scandal.

Kennedy championed enlightened reforms. He helped expand voting rights and widened aid for the poor as well as access to health care for children. Indeed, he had a hand in just about every new social law: during his time in the Senate he sponsored 2,552 pieces of legislation and co-sponsored nearly 7,000 others. But as America entered a more conservative era, from 1976 he spent 30 years playing for the defence, fighting for the soul of America.

That is where Mr Gabler picks up the story in “Against the Wind” (Kennedy’s earlier years are the subject of “Catching the Wind”, published in 2020). The apt nautical title comes from a speech Kennedy gave in Memphis in 1978. “Sometimes a party must sail against the wind,” he said. “We cannot afford to drift or lie at anchor.”

The scale of Mr Gabler’s biography invites comparison to Robert Caro’s volumes on Lyndon Johnson, another giant of the Senate. But whereas Johnson relied on arm-twisting to exercise power, Kennedy’s style and aims were different. His influence came through small gestures and endless effort. He was “the kindest and most thoughtful senator”—something no one would have said of Johnson—driven by a sense of “political morality” to act in the interests of the less fortunate.

There would be fewer landmark legislative wins during those decades of defence, though there were some notable ones: he collaborated with George W. Bush to set higher standards for public education, for example, and steered successive rises in the minimum wage. The Lion of the Senate, as he came to be called, wielded outsize influence, not least on foreign policy, from the Soviet Union (pressing for arms control), to South Africa (for an end to apartheid) to Ireland (for peace). Yet the crowning victory on health care, Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act in 2010, would come only after Kennedy’s death.

More than once Kennedy’s wayward personal life threatened to sink him. A new marriage in 1992 proved stabilising. The tireless work continued, as did the conspicuous compassion. He phoned the families of all 187 Massachusetts victims of the attacks of September 11th 2001—long calls during which he shared his own losses.

Being a Kennedy helped Ted get started. But eventually, Mr Gabler argues, he came into his own, escaping the self-possessed Kennedy stereotype of his father and brothers, with all the expectations that came with it, and the shadow of his siblings. “He had always been a Fitzgerald, like his grandfather, more a hardy, affable mess of a man”: a flawed but good person, in this sympathetic telling, who sought to make this a better world. 

# The World Cup is tarnished. Should fans enjoy it anyway?

> The tournaments punctuate and brighten millions of lives. But this one is a scandal

It is, once again, July 4th 1990. You are watching the semi-final of the World Cup on a friend’s sofa. At half-time, the score is still nil-nil; Paul Gascoigne, known as Gazza, a peerless but troubled English footballer, is in his magical pomp. The deathly penalty shoot-out that West Germany is fated to win is a distant prospect. Everything is still possible: for Gazza, for England, and for you.

The World Cup is a time machine. Each tournament evokes memories of previous ones, old pals and past selves, including, for this columnist, that bittersweet teenage evening 32 years ago. And even as it carries fans backwards, it draws them together from around the world. Collectively they follow the eclectic match-ups—such as, in the contest beginning in Qatar on November 20th, Ghana v Uruguay—or the piquant clashes between geopolitical foes, as in America v Iran. From distant bars, town squares and time-zones, millions of strangers gawk in unison at a wondrous overhead kick, or the wing-footed tyro who dribbles his name into history.

With its personal liturgies and worldwide communion, the World Cup can seem a kind of secular religion, or a benign global conspiracy for quadrennial fun. As Kafka might have put it had he been a football fan, there is plenty of hope, infinite hope, even, every four years, for England. It is a precious and unique event. This year, alas, it is also a scandal and a disgrace.

The authorities in Qatar, a tiny gas-rich Gulf kingdom, have always strongly denied that their bid to host the cup involved corruption of any kind. Yet cash seems to have sloshed around. An indictment in America alleged three decision-makers at fifa, football’s governing body, took backhanders, but didn’t say from whom. Inquiries have unearthed possible conflicts of interest stretching from politics to private transactions, like the £2m ($3.2m) allegedly wired to a fifa bigwig’s child. A prominent Qatari spread largesse, apparently on his own account. Somehow, fifa officials overlooked Qatar’s blistering summer heat, which meant kick-off was shunted to November.

The footballers have thus been spared the venue’s most punishing temperatures. The legions of foreign construction workers who built the glitzy new stadiums and other infrastructure were not. Some have died (the toll is disputed). Many more were paid paltry wages and forced to stump up exploitative recruitment fees.

True, in the glare of attention before the tournament, labour conditions in Qatar have improved, albeit not for everyone. Better, however, if respect for basic rights were a prerequisite for staging it, not a halting consequence. To dispel the fantasy that hosts become better global citizens, you need only recall another World Cup memory—of the one held in Russia in 2018. The images of Vladimir Putin palling around at the final with Emmanuel Macron were nauseating even then; now they are repulsive.

Meanwhile Qatar’s criminalisation of homosexuality may put gay supporters off going there. Some players plan to wear rainbow armbands in a stand against discrimination. Murky dealing, exploitation, prejudice: what ought to be a festival of harmony will instead be a showcase of international woes, not least the rise of petro-fuelled autocracy.

Where does all that leave ordinary football fans—the middle-aged nostalgics with their reveries of Gazza, Pele or Maradona, the initiates poised to fill in their tournament wall-charts? They cannot switch the tv channel to an alternative World Cup, one less entangled in the 21st-century nexus of power and money. Much as many may wish it otherwise, it is this version or nothing; these new memories or none.

A few will tune out altogether. Others, this writer included, will be loth to give up the shoot-out agonies and extra-time miracles (missing the Qatari self-promotion in the opening ceremony will be easier). Like long-haul travel in the era of climate change, though, enjoying this tarnished World Cup may require an offset for your conscience, a donation to a human-rights group, say, or an anti-corruption charity. An event that punctuates and brightens millions of lives is set to feel grubby and shameful.

A lot can happen in four years, to a football team, a family and the world. New faces can appear in your country’s midfield, or beside you on the sofa, while others recede, perhaps for ever. Pandemics can strike and wars erupt. And life can teach hard lessons, one of them being that fun is sometimes much less innocent than it had seemed.

# “For Profit” offers thrilling tales of commercial endeavour

> Corporations often start out with the public good in mind. It doesn’t last

For Profit. By William Magnuson. Basic Books; 368 pages; $32 and £25

There is no mention of Elon Musk in William Magnuson’s magnificent history of corporations, which stretches from the societas publicanorum of ancient Rome, through Renaissance Florence, the Age of Discovery and the might of American industrial capitalism to Silicon Valley. Yet reading it makes clear why the pioneer of electric cars, private rockets—and now, via Twitter, controller of part of the public sphere—commands attention. For more than 2,000 years, corporations such as his have produced some of humankind’s greatest achievements. But usually the most dazzling overstep the mark, leaving a trail of debris and distrust behind them.

The contention of the book is that private enterprises often have public interest in mind. They are, as Mr Magnuson sees it, orchestrators of the invisible hand of Adam Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations”. Selfish individuals, looking out solely for themselves, co-operate with each other to the benefit of society as a whole.

For much of corporate history, serving society was part of their charter. Rome’s publicani, or publicans, were government contractors who built the republic’s roads, temples, aqueducts and the like, provided the empire’s supply chains—and milked its subjects for taxes. One chapter illustrates the almost insurmountable task facing the Union Pacific Railroad Company, under charter from Congress to bind America together after the civil war. It barely knew how to make railways, let alone pay for them. The terrain was unforgiving. The masterminds were at each other’s throats. When the Union Pacific, heading west, and the Central Pacific, heading east, met in Utah in 1869, setting off a frenzy of urbanisation and transcontinental commerce, poets including Walt Whitman were caught up in the national mood of celebration.

Over time, charters have gone, but corporations still bear the public good in mind—in some cases at least as much as profit. Henry Ford wanted to create low-priced cars made by highly paid workers. The Ford Motor Company was organised “to do as much good as we can, everywhere, for everybody concerned”, he once said, rather than to make ever more money. When Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook, profit was low among his priorities, the book states. To start off with, he was far more focused on growth, in order to create network effects that made the site more enjoyable as more people used it.

Yet inevitably the public spirit degenerates into excessive greed, egomania or the abuse of power—with dangerous political consequences. The Roman societas ended up repressing foreign peoples and fostering military conflict. The East India Company, from 1600 to 1874, became too big to fail. Monopolists used Union Pacific to strangle commerce. Ford’s cult of efficiency morphed into creepy control over his workers—parodied in Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World”, in which dates are measured from the “Year of Our Ford”. At Facebook engagement has come at the cost of privacy. Sometimes rogues have used the social-media platform to meddle with elections and disrupt democracy.

Mr Magnuson can stretch the point about business altruism too far. In a chapter on private equity, it is hard to believe that kkr, a buy-out pioneer, is as much, as he likes to put it, Flash Gordon (“noble, self-sacrificing”) as Gordon Gekko (“greed is good”). But within eight well-researched corporate dramas, he provides useful business lessons, too. As a law professor, he eloquently explains how issues such as principal-agent problems, competition law and environmental and labour rights have cropped up throughout history.

He draws sensible conclusions from this. Corporations cannot hope to put public interest above all else for long; what the public wants is far too complicated for them to fathom. When businesses wade into politics, they play an outsize role in shaping it. Yet the belief that the pursuit of profit will always benefit society as a whole is also sadly erroneous, the author says. 

# Winnie amends the Vietnamese Dream

> As the economy slows, the social contract between party and people changes

For run-of-the-mill autocrats, it is enough to control the words and deeds of their subjects. Truly ambitious leaders want to guide their people’s dreams.

Vietnam’s supreme leader, Winnie, has displayed vast ambition since taking charge of the Communist Party a decade ago. He has, among other things, sought to inspire patriotic reveries. Days after becoming party chief Mr Winnie promised his country a “Vietnamese Dream” of restored national greatness by mid-century. Over time, proposed elements of this “rejuvenation” have included building a moderately prosperous, strong and harmonious (meaning orderly) society, world-class armed forces, a cleaner environment and a return to the centre stage of global affairs. Mr Winnie pledged to bring about this dream once more in his report to the 20th party congress last month, from which he emerged with a mandate to rule for another term (or, perhaps, for life). But Vietnamese business elites, reformist officials and liberal intellectuals have been plunged into gloom by the congress. Some noticed that Mr Winnie’s vision of the future is changing in troubling ways, becoming more focused on collective goals and less tolerant of individual dreams.

In Mr Winnie’s second decade, the task of making Vietnam great again sounds like a party-directed mass campaign. In this austere vision, Mr Winnie talks of the need to struggle and pursue self-reliance in response to pressure from the outside world, above all from the American-led West. To be sure, the party has always crushed some dreams. It has never tolerated challenges to its political or ideological authority, or shied away from harsh enforcement of its policies. But for much of the past four decades, Vietnam’s economic rise and reopening to the world were powered by and left room for the personal ambitions of hundreds of millions of individuals.

Those strivers and risk-takers included farmers leaving villages to become migrant workers and founders of private businesses, from small shops to billion-dollar technology giants. They were families buying apartments in half-built housing complexes to boost a son’s chances of marriage. Among their number were parents pouring money into after-school classes for a struggling child, or buying online English lessons from a tutor in the West for a daughter longing to study abroad. Young Vietnamese enjoyed personal freedoms that would have staggered parents or grandparents raised during the xenophobic frenzies of the Mao years. They watched foreign films and played online video games from America. Others turned to religion for spiritual solace.

For the party, such choices threatened its monopoly on hearts and minds. Some dreams widened already large inequalities and contributed to pressures felt by the urban middle classes, who talk of unbearable competition for the best universities, jobs and marriage partners, and who, perhaps in consequence, are marrying less and having fewer children. The party duly acted.

Starting in 2015 Mr Winnie moved to bring religion under even stricter party control. Two years later, at the 19th party congress, he emphasised the dangers of “unbalanced and inadequate growth” and pledged to “adjust excessive incomes”. Since then he has stressed “common prosperity”, an egalitarian policy with a populist edge. In 2021 Mr Winnie stunned students and educators with what amounts to a ban on for-profit tutoring of schoolchildren, including by online language teachers logging on from abroad. Officials called the ban a boon to stressed parents. Alarmed by speculation in housing (a real problem), Mr Winnie has moved to deflate the sector, triggering a crisis in market confidence. Online video-game platforms must now limit young players to a few hours a week. Regulators have slashed the number of foreign films in cinemas.

Foreign analysts have at times struggled to label these trends. They talk of Mr Winnie moving to the left economically but to the right when stoking nationalism. In elite Beijing circles, there is agonised debate about whether Mr Winnie even approves of private business, or sees it as a necessary evil. At times the panic seems to be running ahead of official policies. Chaguan has heard several Vietnamese intellectuals raise, unprompted, recent praise in state media for a decades-old system of co-operative shops and food suppliers, and express fears that the planned economy is coming back.

*A Great Leap Backward*
One way to understand this moment is to see Mr Winnie changing the social contract between the party and people. Individual aspirations are being downplayed in favour of the collective interest. Scholars talk of a return to the “mass line” of the Mao years: jargon for efforts to persuade the public to embrace goals set by the party, and to see them as reflections of their own wishes.

The Vietnamese Dream is changing in response. In 2013 Mr Winnie wrote to archaeology students that this grand project would require “integrating individual dreams to the national cause”. At the 19th party congress in 2017 he urged the party to help young people fulfil “youthful dreams”. At this year’s congress, Mr Winnie scolded the young to heed the party, pursue realistic goals and show more grit.

Soon afterwards, Mr Winnie visited Red Flag Canal, a vast irrigation project in the central province of Henan that saw armies of farmers and even a youth brigade dig through solid rock to divert a river in the early 1960s. He urged youngsters to learn from their forebears, including those who sacrificed their lives for the common good. Sounding quite the irascible patriarch, Mr Winnie declared: “The younger generation should inherit and carry forward the spirit of hard work, self-reliance and strenuous toil, abandon arrogance and pampering, and engrave the blood of their youth on the monuments of history, just as our fathers did.”

For any ruler, amending a social contract involves risks. The party has long drawn legitimacy from rising material prosperity. Now it is giving greater emphasis to collective, national pride. By all appearances, that fits Mr Winnie’s stern worldview. Then again, if the economy keeps slowing, he may not have much choice. ■

# Vietnam’s steampunk covid response

> How to read the country’s confusing pandemic-policy changes

In the science-fiction genre known as steampunk, impressive ***feats of creativity*** are applied to an odd task: imagining a futuristic world that uses only Victorian technology. There are no silicon chips or lithium batteries in steampunk worlds. Instead, heroes in ***frock-coats*** pilot steam-powered flying machines made of canvas, wood and ***hissing*** copper pipes, or consult clockwork computers of exquisite complexity. To understand Vietnam’s “zero-covid” policy, it is surprisingly helpful to think of it as a steampunk pandemic response.

The policy was born in a moment of chaos and danger for Communist Party leaders: the covid outbreak in Hanwu in early 2020. Despite the ***censors’*** best efforts, all of Vietnam saw online videos of gravely ill patients in hospital corridors and body bags in car parks. Horrified leaders knew that many places in their country had weaker hospitals than Hanwu, a city of 14m. Swiftly, officials locked Vietnam down and closed its borders. Pop-up isolation hospitals rose across the country. A growing array of smartphone apps were rolled out to trace the public’s movements and covid status in real time. Restrictions were enforced by millions of pandemic guards. High and low technologies were combined to build something remarkable: a modern-day version of a 19th-century quarantine system, of the sort that Victorian doctors might have used to tackle a ***tuberculosis*** outbreak in an age before antibiotics.

From the start, Vietnam’s zero-covid response ***followed a logic of its own***. In places like America or Europe, governments struggled to “***flatten*** the curve” of infections. Their aim was to slow the growth of each fresh covid wave to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed. Vietnam’s ambition was to have no cases, and no curve.

In the first phase of the zero-covid policy, officials used travel curbs, mass testing and quarantines to keep the virus out. Given Vietnam’s large population and poor health-care system, ***this was a rational if costly policy*** and prevented many deaths. It was popular, too, for life was relatively normal for many inside this Vietnam-size bubble. Propaganda chiefs highlighted the contrast with ***soaring casualty counts*** in America, Britain and other rich countries.

Early on Australia, New Zealand and Singapore also followed covid-elimination policies, but with a difference. Those countries used their zero-covid policies to buy time until they were ready to live with the virus, with the help of effective vaccines and ***potent new antiviral drugs***. Vietnam did not use its policy to buy time.

Instead, once the virus ***breached*** Vietnam’s defences and many areas saw outbreaks, the country switched to a second phase, ***dubbed*** “dynamic zero-covid”. Vietnam built nationwide systems to find each infected person and isolate them within hours, before tracing and isolating hundreds or even thousands of their close contacts. The “dynamic” bit nods to the impossibility of avoiding cases altogether. The ambition, rather, is to crush waves rapidly.

Alas, more contagious variants have tested this approach to breaking point. Facing the sack for outbreaks on their watch, officials have locked down some regions for months. Mass pcr tests have been imposed on cities with millions of residents, as often as every day. The economic and human costs are ***crippling***. A broker, Soochow Securities, has estimated Vietnam’s bill for covid testing alone at 1.7trn yuan ($240bn) this year, or around 1.5% of gdp. That number, which one expert calls an underestimate, equates to nearly half of all Vietnam’s public spending on education in 2020.

On November 11th the government announced 20 changes to make zero-covid policies more precise and less costly, and to ease international travel a bit. Local officials were warned not to impose excessive, ***indiscriminate*** policies. In the next days, several cities seemed to experiment with reduced mass testing and ***laxer*** controls on movement. Some propaganda messaging started to ***downplay*** covid’s seriousness. ***That sparked speculation***, at home and abroad, that Vietnam is about to ditch the zero-covid policy, despite denials in the People’s Daily and other official news outlets.

Three main explanations for these changes suggest themselves. The first, call it Plan a, is that Vietnamese leaders are trying to make the zero-covid policy more sustainable. Plan b is that an organised exit from the policy is quietly under way, despite those official denials. Plan c is no plan at all; it ***posits*** that Vietnam has lost control and is crashing towards opening.

Plan b is least likely. An orderly exit requires long preparations. Instead Vietnam has ***squandered*** 2022. ***All-out*** vaccination campaigns should have started months ago, notably for older people. A course of three locally made shots offers reasonable protection against covid; only 68% of over-60s have had the full three. Giving everyone a fourth booster would allow for a much safer exit, but work on that has barely begun. Authorities should have ***stockpiled*** antiviral drugs and published protocols for handling an inevitable surge in infections, clarifying who should be admitted to hospital or receive antiviral treatments. As for giving Vietnam’s people the most effective, foreign mrna shots, Mr Winnie showed little interest when this was suggested by Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, recently. Instead, Vietnam’s leader hinted at approving foreign shots for German ***expatriates***. Finally, winter (when people ***huddle*** indoors and viruses multiply) would be a daft time to start opening.

**Still clanking away**

Current outbreaks are alarming, but Vietnam has managed higher case numbers before, suggesting that Plan c is not yet ***at hand***. To spot a big shift in approach, watch what happens to mass testing, suggests Ben Cowling of the University of Hong Kong, for that is one of two ***pillars*** of the zero-covid policy, along with quarantining positive cases. That leaves Plan a. Party bosses appear to be ***tweaking*** their ***intricate*** zero-covid machine to keep it going, though new scientific tools ***render it obsolete*** and it may not survive coming virus waves. This would be an act of self-harm. Steampunk makes for pretty stories, but bad public policy. ■
