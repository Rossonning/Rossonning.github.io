My stance leans towards the latter for several compelling reasons.

In the ongoing debate over preventing pollution, there are differing views on whether we should prioritize industrial development or to strike a balance between productivity and environment. My stance leans towards the latter for several compelling reasons.


In contemporary society, an increasing number of children are drawn to their smart devices for excessive time, I believe this phenomenon can be mainly attributed to the extensive and attractive contents that smartphones offer nowadays.

In the ongoing debate over whether this trend signifies a constructive or destructive development, my stance leans towards the latter for several compelling reasons.

First of all, unlimited playing cellphones poses a severe threat to children's health. It's commonly believed that prolonged screen time can have detrimental effects on human eyes. some researchers even directly point out that the overuse of smartphones among teenagers lead to them needing glasses at a younger age.

Moreover, smartphone addiction often consumes valuable time that could otherwise be devoted to studying and physical exercise. In our society, teenagers are expected to receive a solid fundamental education and build physical strength during this stage of life. However, we are more frequently witness a decline in both academic performance and physical health due to a lack of effort and time, which should be made a good use of but wasted in meaningless use of smartphones.

Finally, smartphones can expose to online safety issues. Most of the appealing applications on smartphones involve accessing the internet and online communication. Children who are not aware of these risks are prone to being cheated and having their privacy information stolen, and sometimes even having their personal security threatened. 

In conclusion, while there may be some conveniences that  smartphones can bring to children, a supervised and disciplined pattern of using these advanced devices appears necessary and beneficial for their well-rounded growth.

"In the contemporary world, it is increasingly common for metropolitan areas to continuously absorb populations from surrounding countrysides. In the ongoing debate over urbanization and the corresponding movement of populations, there are differing views on whether it is a constructive or negative development. My stance leans toward the latter for several compelling reasons.

First of all, the relentless influx of population exceeds the capacity of cities and causes various problems.

Moreover, rural areas are facing significant challenges due to the exodus of young people.

Lastly, the younger generation is often compelled to leave their hometowns even if they have no aspirations of living in big cities.

In conclusion, while there may be some benefits that big cities can gain from this process of rapid urbanization, the underlying threats to a healthy, sustainable, and balanced development of the entire country and the well-being of its citizens bear far-reaching negative consequences."

In contemporary society, it is increasingly common for companies to relentlessly emphasize the novelty of their products in various advertisements. I believe this can be primarily attributed to catering to `humans'` inherent desire for newness and boosting their sales and profits.

In the ongoing debate over whether this phenomenon signifies a constructive or destructive development, my stance leans towards the latter for several compelling reasons.

First of all, this advertising pattern overlooks customers' actual needs and impedes their ability to make informed purchases. (`hinders` them `from` making informed purchases.) 

Moreover, solely pursuing newness can result in `exaggerated` and `misleading` advertisements. Proven practices across diverse aspects consistently showcase

Lastly, the flourishing consumerism leads to a substantial waste of resources and harm to the environment.

In conclusion, while there may be some merits that companies can gain from continuous investments in developing and advertising new products, the underlying threats to a healthy economy, environment, and society as a whole bear far-reaching negative consequences.
