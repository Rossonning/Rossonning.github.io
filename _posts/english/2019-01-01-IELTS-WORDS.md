- so we've had to postpone installing an elevator
- Could you spell that for me please?
- Okay. Right, well that's about all I need to know
- you'll need to come in to the library and `fill out/fill in` some forms
- Like all libraries there's a fine system `in place`.
- Its economy has been totally transformed.
- I went there in 1993 `just after graduating from university.`
- Then I realized having a bike meant `he could get where he wanted to go` without much trouble.
- Other local carpenters could only accept jobs `in a three-kilometer radius,`
- But `in order to continue operating` we need to have `a constant supply` of bikes which we send out every six months.
- The local economy has developed so much, `you wouldn't recognize it as the same place.`
- Winning the award helped `raise our profile`, and the money enabled us to pay all our shipping costs, which `represent our greatest expense.`
- We're currently looking to invest in computers `so that` our office staff `can do an even better job`.
- Because of our work, people in `a number of` countries now `have a better standard of living`
- Now there are `many ways in` which you can support the work of Pedal Power
- `we're always interested to` hear of other places that would benefit from receiving a consignment of bikes,
- Do you think you'll `maintain the contact now?`
- They don't speak as slowly as most of the tutors on our course. I think they speak `at natural speed`, so it forces me to `get used to it`. And they use `a lot of slang`.
- if you had to do it `all over again`, is there anything you'd do differently?
- I think we should have tried to `experiment more with the camera`.
- So you `should have been more ambitious`? Do you agree, Ibrahim?
- `Not really`. In fact, I think we were too ambitious, We were `inexperienced`
- you'll have an opportunity to `put into practice` what you've learnt this time
- with very low snowfall, most of the continent technically `falls` unbelievably `into the category of` 'desert'!
- Here science and technical support `have been integrated in a very cost-effective way`
- I `was based on` one of the all-year-round ones.
- The research stations are really `self-contained` communities of about twenty people.
- People living there need to obtain a lot more energy from their food, both to keep warm and to `undertake heavy physical work.`
- Rations for `fieldwork` `present` an additional problem.
- `You may be familiar with` coffee processed by `freeze-drying`, which `preserves` the quality of the food product while making a large saving in weight-well
- I think that being `at the cutting edge of science` has a special `appeal` for everyone
- As well as that, these records of sound levels `take no account of` the fact that people vary in their perceptions of noise 
- so someone like me with years of working in acoustics `might be very different from` you `in that regard`.
- we need rules and regulations because noise can cause `all sorts of problems`.
- city-dwellers know that things `go on 24 hours a day`, so city-dwellers often suffer from `interrupted sleep`
- And `there are other problems as well`, for instance if schoolchildren don't have a quiet place to study `their work will suffer`.
- it doesn't `differentiate between` different types of noise.
- So maybe researchers `should consider these sorts of sounds` in urban design.
- Instead, many researchers are using social science `techniques`
- Some recent interdisciplinary research `has come out with results` that `at first sight` seem `contradictory`
- city needs to have `a sense of activity`, so it needs to be `lively`, with sounds like the `clack of high heels` on a `pavement` or the `hiss` of a coffee machine, but these mustn't be too `intrusive` because at the same time we need to be able to relax.
- `One of the major problems` in achieving this will be getting architects and town planners to use the research.
- Apart from studying the `basics` of acoustics, these people receive very little training `in this area.`
- If we `acknowledge` this, then we `urgently` need to know what governs it and `how designers can work with it`
- The way that sound affects our `thought` and feelings?
- `There are quite a few people` `advocating for` this campaign
- I'm just `jotting down` some notes.
- Let me just check.
- Now there are just two more apartments `to ask you about`. Um, I can't `read my own writing`!
- Each room has its own sun terrace and there are shared barbecue `facilities`.
- I don't think that would be `within our budget`, unfortunately
- Well, there are forests `all round` and they hide a supermarket just down the road
- so that's very `useful for all your shopping needs.`
- 319 at that time, but if you leave it till November `it goes down by 40%.`
-  why don't I send you a brochure `with full details`, Ms…?
-  I just wanted to `get an idea` first.
-  `If you've got a minute`, could I just `check a couple of points` about insurance? 
-  That's good - of course our holiday `won't even` cost 1,000 together!
-  Then `I'd better not` take my laptop!
-  `Not unless` you insure it separately.
-  perhaps you can begin by telling us `a little bit about` `how it all started.`
-  we didn't `think anything more of it` until I `went on a trip to` a theme park near Birmingham and decided we could do a much better job
-  they didn't want our `guests` to have a `miserable`, wet visit.
-  `It soon became clear that` we were onto a winner.
-  Winridge is one of the most popular `visitor attractions` in the area
-  Our son, Duncan, has been a stalwart of the park `for the last ten years`, `taking over` from me in the area of construction
-  and I'll say a little bit more about that `in a moment`
-  So have you finished your development of the site `for the moment?`
-  The railway remains `the central feature` and there's now 1.2 kilometres of the line laid but we'd like to lay more.
-  Again the problem is the geology; we had to level the mounds on the track `for safety reasons.`
-  We wanted to enable 5-12 year olds to use the `go-karts.`
-  Didn't Mr Blake `make a fuss about us` leaving that behind?
-  It was clear, but I don't think we need `all these details` of ...
-  so I had to start `all over again.`
-  But at least I'd got the squared paper `or I'd have had problems` drawing it all to scale. Yes.
-  OK. I'll make my `amendments` using those, then I can scan it into our report. Great.
-  or even destroyed by being `smashed` against the rocks.
-  we `weren't concentrating on` that
-  But we could ask him which books on our Reading List `might be most helpful.`
-  But we might not be `all that accurate` as far as `the actual numbers go.`
-  they were adequate `in this context`
-  we'd better mention that.
-  how it relates to the people it's built for.
-  a sort of `metaphor` for the building and the way in which it is used.
-  The location chosen was a site in a `run-down` district
-  The whole area `was some distance from` the `high-rise` office blocks
-  but it was only one kilometre from the `ring road`.
-  The site itself `was bordered to` the north by a canal which had once been used by boats bringing in raw materials.
-  Harrison decided to create `pedestrian` access to the building
-  He wanted to give people a feeling of `suspense` as they see the building first from a distance, and then close-up,
-  The first side that people see, the southern wall, is just a high, flat wall `uninterrupted by any windows`. 
-  This might sound `off-putting`, but it supports Harrison's concept of the building that the person approaching is `intrigued` and `wonders` what will be inside.
-  The acoustics are also adjustable `according to the size of orchestra` and the type of music being played.
-  `In spite of` Harrison s efforts to use local materials, they criticise the style of the design as being international rather than local,
-  Well, I think `I'm coping well with` statistics, and `I'm never bored by it`.
-  Oh yes, if possible. It's just that `I'm having difficulty thinking` how I can do that. You see I feel I don't `have sufficient background information`. 
-  `I'm very weak at` note-taking. My teachers always used to say that.
-  `It really helps build confidence`, you know, having to present something to others.
-  Yes, unfortunately `there are only a few places`. But `it's worth looking into`.
-  Well, yes, `I've never done that before.`
-  Another thing I always advise is don't just `take your notes` and forget about them. Read everything three times - that'll really `fix them in your mind.`
-  Oh yes, I completely agree. It's just that `I don't seem to be able to discipline myself`. I need to talk things over.
-  if you `establish good study skills at this stage` they'll be with you all your life.
-  Let's see, I can see you `virtually` any time during the week `starting` 22nd January.
-  Fine, we'll `go for` the 25th then.
-  Good morning. `In the last few lectures` I've been talking about the history of domestic building construction.
-  But today I want to `begin looking at` some contemporary, experimental designs for housing.
-  So the first thing they did was to look for a site. And they found `a disused stone quarry` in a beautiful area.
-  As it was, the quarry `was an ugly blot on the landscape`, and it wasn't `productive` any longer, either.
-  They consulted various architects and `looked at` a number of designs before finally deciding on one.
-  It was built into the earth itself, with two `stories`
-  There were also `photovoltaic` tiles fixed to the top and bottom of this sloping wall.
-  And the walls had a layer of `foam` around them too, to increase the `insulation`.
-  Now, `what is of interest to us` about this project is the features which make the building energy-efficient.
-  Sunlight `floods in` through the glass wall, and to maximize it there are lots of mirrors and windows inside the house.
-  In fact, and it's possible that in future the house may even generate an electricity `surplus`, and that the owners will be able to sell some to `the national grid`.
-  For example, the floors are made of `reclaimed` wood.
-  And the owners `haven't bought a single` item of new furniture-they just kept what they already had.
-  So the `occupants` of the house won't pollute the land or use any damaging chemicals.
-  Mainly because they had to use `massive amounts of` concrete, `one of the biggest sources of` carbon dioxide in manufacturing.
-  Now that's a `frightening` thought.
-  However, once the initial '`debt`' has been `cleared` - and it's been `calculated` that this will only `take fifteen years` -
-  I'd like to know where we can all `register with` a doctor at a Health Centre.
-  Oh…actually my youngest child is five, so `that wouldn't be any good for us`.
-  Is there `anywhere` else I could try?
-  there are usually `some small charges` that doctors `make`.
-  Let me see `what it says` about the Shore Lane Centre.
-  If you need to be `vaccinated` before any trips abroad. you won't have to pay for this.
-  The sports injury treatment service `operates on a paying basis`
-  Some health centres do offer `alternative therapies` like `homeopathy` as part of their `pay-to-use service`.
-  Shore Lane are hoping to do this soon-I think they may start with `acupuncture`.
-  You `might also be interested to know` the Centre is `running a pilot scheme` of talks for patients.
-  What sort of things?
-  actually it's at the primary school on Shore Lane. I imagine they're inviting the parents of `pupils` there-it says here 'all welcome.'
- one giving advice about how to avoid `injuries` while doing exercise.
- We've just arrived at the holiday flat, but I can't `get the hot water and heating to work.`
- In the upstairs `cupboard`, you'll find the water heater.
- It's the main control switch. Make sure `it's in the 'on' position.`
- The switch itself doesn't `light up`, but the little `square` below will be black if the switch is 'off'.
- That's probably what's happened-`it's got switched off` by mistake.
- The middle one of these three controls-you'll see it's slightly larger than the first one-controls the `radiators`.
- The last of the three controls-the one on the right-is usually on about a number for setting which for the water in the taps is usually quite hot enough.
- If there isn't enough water in the pipes, sometimes the heater `goes out`.
- `Hold it in for` about `five seconds` and the heater should `come on again`
- It sounds complicated…
- `While you're on the phone`, we `haven't managed to` find `a few things` we need
- And if you have any trouble with the lamps, you'll find some `spare bulbs` in a large `cardboard` box.
- I've left you a local map, so you'll be able to `find your way around` easily.
- It shows the whole area. I put it `in the top drawer of the chest` under the TV in your bedroom.
- You have to pay to leave your car in `all the car parks` now `I'm afraid`
- That's where all the best restaurants are.
- But if you want a `takeaway`, the Italian one does really good pasta and pizzas.
- They're both good and they'll both `deliver to the flat.`
- They `credited me with` two years, which probably made it more difficult for me.
- On the other hand, you were lucky to be `granted` credits. Is that why you chose the course?
- People expect you to have problems with the process of reading and writing, but, in fact, `it is more a question of` `altering your viewpoint towards` academic study.
- Maybe you found them different because you're a more `mature` student now, whereas when you were studying in your country you were younger and not so `assertive`.
- but sometimes just about something that might really interest them, something they might want to `specialize in.`
- The lecturers must `set aside certain times` every week when they're available for students.
- Then in second semester, we had to get experience in hospital `dispensaries`, so `every second day` we went to one of the big hospitals and worked there.
- And `on top of all that` we had our assignments, which took me a lot of time.
- because you can be in big trouble if you don't understand what people are saying and `you haven't got time to translate.`
- as I said before, the biggest problem for me was `a lack of familiarity with` the education system here.
- two of the group mentioned that they had seen `yet` more sparrow-hawks in their own city centre gardens and `wondered why` they were `turning up` in these gardens `in great numbers. `
- The first thing we did was to `establish what proportion of` the urban land `is taken up by` private gardens.
- We estimated that it was about one fifth, and this was `endorsed` by looking at large-scale usage maps in the town land survey office-24% `to be precise.`
- `ticking off` species they had seen from a pro forma list-and adding the names of any rarer ones.
- We `deliberately` chose smaller ones because they were by far the most typical in the city.
- `The whole point of` the project was to `look at the norm` not the `exception`.
- because we felt these `gave a good indication of` the processes at work in rural and urban `settings` as a whole.
- Another factor is the `provision` of nesting places-which is actually better in gardens than the countryside. Hard to believe it, but it's true.
- `Incidentally`, we discovered that a massive new survey on song thrushes `is about to be launched`, so you should `keep an eye open for` that.
- there are several free concerts taking place at different times - one or two in the morning, the majority `at lunchtime`, and a couple in the evening.
- And they `range from` pop music to Latin American.
- So it's a good idea to bring `binoculars` if you have them.
- How long does it take to get there by car from Burnham?
- Barford has changed a great deal in the last 50 years
- because the bus companies `concentrate on` just the routes that `attract most passengers`.
- It's sometimes said that bus fares are too high, but `in relation to` average incomes, fares are not much higher than they were 50 years ago.
- The centre was recently `closed to traffic` on a `trial basis`, making it much safer for `pedestrians`
- `Numbers have been falling for several years`, despite efforts to attract `shoppers`, for instance by opening new car parks.
- Our hospital closed 15 years ago, which means journeys to other towns are `unavoidable`.
- The number of schools and colleges has increased, making that `the main employment sector`.
- Instead, the company has bought some `adjoining` land, and this will be used to increase the number of parking spaces.
- It's become more and more `shabby-looking`, and because of fears about safety, it was threatened with demolition.
- What will change, though, is that the council will no longer `be in charge of` the area.
- And the tiger stops `in the middle of` what it's doing when it sees Malcolm `walking past`.
- That's right, you wanted them to be watching a `carnival procession`, but I thought it would be too crowded. Do you think it works like this?
- No, `he's been left out of all the fun`, so I'd like him to be crying, that'll `contrast` nicely `with` the next picture, where he's laughing at the clowns in the carnival.
- Because `they've supposed to be` skating on grass, aren't they?
- At the moment `it doesn't look quite right.`
- Mm, `I see what you mean`. I'll `have another go at that.`
- `How do you feel about` drafting something,
- I'd be happier if you did it
- So what `has` it gotten to do with business, you may ask. 
- They watched how cooks used measuring cups to `measure out` things like sugar and flour.
- Ethnographic research has also been `carried out` in computer companies.
- the researcher has to be completely `open-minded`
- he or she hasn't `thought up` a hypothesis to be tested, `as is the case` in other types of research.
- the `criteria` `according to` which the participants are chosen may be something as simple as `the age bracket they fall into,`

You are a native English speaker who has complete mastery of the language. I'm currently preparing for the speaking section of the IELTS General Training exam. Could you assist me by categorizing and providing some commonly used connective phrases by native speakers based on different functional scenarios? It would be really helpful if you could provide example sentences to illustrate their usage.

# Grammar
## Impressive, Impressed, Impressing
Impressive:
Adjective: "Impressive" is used to describe something that leaves a strong, favorable, or striking impact on others. It suggests that something is remarkable or capable of evoking admiration.

Example sentences:
"`Her presentation was very impressive`; she covered all the key points."
"The architecture of `the ancient cathedral is truly impressive`."

Impressed:
Verb (past tense): "Impressed" is the past tense of the verb "impress." It is used to describe the feeling or state of being affected positively by something or someone. When you are impressed, you are showing that you found something to be noteworthy or admirable.

Example sentences:
"I was really impressed by his knowledge of the subject."
"She was impressed with the quality of the artwork."

Impressing:
Present Participle (Gerund): "Impressing" is the present participle form of the verb "impress." It is used when talking about an ongoing action or process of making a positive impact or gaining admiration from others.

Example sentences:
"He is constantly impressing us with his dedication to his work."
"She keeps impressing the judges with her singing talent."

In summary, "impressive" is an adjective used to describe something notable, "impressed" is the past tense of the verb used to convey the feeling of being affected positively, and "impressing" is the present participle used to describe an ongoing action of making a positive impact or gaining admiration.

## Seek, Seek for
Seek: 
"Seek" is a verb that means to attempt to find or search for something. It is a more direct and concise way of expressing the act of searching or looking for something. 
For example:
"I seek knowledge." (Direct and concise)
"She seeks happiness." (Direct and concise)

Seek for: 
"Seek for" is a less common variation of the verb "seek." It also means to search for or look for something, but it is somewhat more formal and less commonly used in everyday speech. It may appear in formal writing or older texts. 
For example:
"They sought for answers to their questions." `(Formal or older style)`
In many cases, you can use "seek" or "seek for" `interchangeably` without a significant difference in meaning. However, as mentioned earlier, `"seek" is the more common and straightforward choice in contemporary English`. So, unless you have a specific reason to use "seek for" for stylistic or formal purposes, it's generally preferable to use "seek" alone.
## Cloth， Clothes, Clothing
Cloth: 
"Cloth" refers to a material or fabric that is made from fibers such as cotton, wool, silk, etc. It's the raw material that clothing is typically made from. 
For example, you might say, "`I spilled coffee on my white cloth napkin`."

Clothes: 
"Clothes" is the plural form of "clothing." It refers to the garments or items of clothing that people wear to cover their bodies. "Clothes" is used to talk about the things you put on every day, like shirts, pants, dresses, and shoes. 
For example, "`I need to buy some new clothes for the summer.`"

Clothing: 
"Clothing" is a more general term that encompasses all types of garments and attire. It's an `uncountable` noun, so you don't use it in the plural form. "Clothing" can refer to a person's entire wardrobe or the general category of items worn to cover the body. 
For example, "`The store sells a wide range of clothing for men, women, and children.`"

`In summary, while "clothing" can often replace "clothes"`

## In the morning, on the morning
In the Morning:

Use "in the morning" to refer to a general, unspecified time during the morning hours, typically from the time you wake up until around noon.
Example: "I like to have a cup of coffee in the morning."
On the Morning:

Use "on the morning" when you want to specify a particular morning, such as a specific date or day.
Example: "I will see you on the morning of July 15th."

## Been to, Gone to
Both "I have been to..." and "I have gone to..." are grammatically correct and convey similar meanings, but there is a subtle difference in their usage:

"I have been to...":

This phrase is used to indicate that you have visited a place `at some point in your life`, and you are now sharing that experience.
It emphasizes the experience of visiting the place.
It is often used when the focus is on the fact that you've had the opportunity to go there.
Example: "I have been to Paris several times, and I love the city."

"I have gone to...":

This phrase is also used to indicate that you have visited a place, but it may carry a slightly different nuance.
It can imply that you went to the place and returned or that you are talking about a specific trip or instance of going to that place.
It can also be used when `the focus is on the action of going to the place rather than the overall experience.`
Example: "I have gone to the local seafood market before to buy fresh fish."

## receptor, recipient
Receptor:
A "receptor" is typically a noun that refers to a specialized cell or molecule in an organism that `receives signals, stimuli, or information`. For example, in biology and physiology, receptors are often discussed in the context of sensory organs or cells that respond to specific stimuli, such as photoreceptors in the eyes that detect light.

Recipient:
"Recipient" is also a noun, but it refers to `a person or entity that receives something`, often `in a broader sense`. It can refer to someone who receives a gift, an award, a message, or any kind of transfer. For example, if you send a letter to someone, that person is the recipient of the letter.

## people's life, people's lives
The correct phrase depends on the context.

"People's life" is singular and would be used `when talking about the collective life of a group of people or the concept of life in general`. For example: "The preservation of people's life is of utmost importance."

"People's lives" is plural and would be used `when referring to the individual lives of multiple people`. For example: "The pandemic has affected many people's lives."

## Luggage, baggage
Both "luggage" and "baggage" are commonly used terms in English to refer to the personal belongings that a person takes with them when traveling. They are essentially synonymous, and you can use either one in most situations. However, there is a slight difference in usage:

"Luggage" is a more general term and can refer to suitcases, bags, and other containers used for carrying personal items. It's the broader term.

"Baggage" is often used specifically to refer to the bags and suitcases people `bring with them` when traveling. `It's a subset of luggage.`

Here are some examples:

"I packed my luggage for the trip."
"Please make sure to collect your baggage from the carousel at the airport."
"I have a lot of luggage to carry."
## Thesis, paper, essay
"Essay," "thesis," 和 "paper" 是三种不同类型的学术和文学作品，它们之间的区别如下：

论文 (Thesis):
一篇长篇研究性作品，通常由研究生在完成学位课程时撰写。
通常包括对特定主题的深入研究和分析，以及原创性的贡献。
要求有系统的研究、文献综述、方法学、实验、结果分析和结论等部分。
最终目标是为了获得学位，如硕士或博士学位。

论文 (Paper):
一篇短篇或中等篇幅的学术文章，通常发表在学术期刊或会议上。
旨在传达作者的研究成果、新发现或理论观点。
有时也可以是综述性的文章，总结领域内的最新进展。
可能是某个研究项目的一部分，或者是学术界交流的一种方式。

论文 (Essay):
一篇短篇文章，通常包括作者的观点、观点或解释某一主题。
通常不像论文或学术论文那样要求严格的研究。
可以用于学术写作，但也常用于一般文学作品，例如小说评论或个人观点表达。
这些是这三种学术和文学作品之间的基本区别。要根据具体的上下文和写作目的来选择使用哪种形式。

## for me, to me
In the sentence "Taking photos is a marvelous way of spending a day off to me," both "to me" and "for me" are correct and can be used interchangeably with a slight difference in nuance:

"To me": This suggests a personal preference or opinion. It indicates that you find taking photos to be a wonderful way to spend your day off, and it's something you personally enjoy or appreciate.

"For me": This also implies personal preference but may emphasize more the idea that taking photos is beneficial or suitable for you as an individual. It suggests that, in your case, it works well as an activity for a day off.

Both expressions convey a similar idea, but "to me" places a bit more emphasis on your personal enjoyment, while "for me" may emphasize the suitability or benefit of the activity for you. However, in this context, they are quite interchangeable, and the choice between them is a matter of subtle nuance.

## wake, awaken
Wake（动词）：通常指从睡眠中醒来或使某人从睡梦中醒来。例如，"I wake up at 7 AM every morning"（我每天早上7点醒来）。

Awaken（动词）：也表示从睡眠中醒来，但它通常用于更正式或文学性的语境中。例如，"The sound of birds singing awakened her/ She is awakened by the sound of birds' singing"（鸟儿的歌声唤醒了她）。

## little, few
Few (几乎没有)：通常用于可数名词（countable nouns），表示数量上的稀缺或缺乏。
例如，"There are few apples left in the basket" 意味着篮子里剩下很少的苹果。

Little (几乎没有)：通常用于不可数名词（uncountable nouns），表示数量上的稀缺或缺乏。
例如，"There is little milk left in the bottle" 意味着瓶子里几乎没有牛奶了。

A few (一些，几个)：通常用于可数名词（countable nouns），表示数量上的少量，但是足够多以满足某种需要或期望。
例如，"I have a few books to read" 意味着我有一些书要阅读，可能不多但足够。

A little (一些，一点点)：通常用于不可数名词（uncountable nouns），表示数量上的少量，但足以满足某种需要或期望。
例如，"Could you add a little sugar to my tea?" 意味着请给我的茶加一点糖，只需一点点。

## ethical, moral
Moral (道德的)："Moral" 强调个体或社会中的道德原则和价值观，通常与个人内心的伦理和行为准则有关。"Moral" 更侧重于对权与错、善与恶的判断。例如，我们可以说一个人有 "good moral values"，表示他有良好的道德价值观。

Ethical (伦理的)："Ethical" 通常涉及到道德和伦理规范在特定领域或专业中的应用。它更关注社会和职业上的行为准则，例如在医学、法律、商业等领域的伦理规范。"Ethical" 强调的是在特定环境下遵循的行为准则和规范。例如，我们可以说医生有 "ethical obligations"，指的是医学伦理中的职业道德义务。

## technological, technical
1. Technical (技术的)：这个词通常用来形容与特定技能、过程或领域相关的事物。它强调了对技术性或专业性问题的关注，可能涉及到技能、方法或程序。例如，你可以说 "He has a technical background" 意思是他有技术方面的背景或专业知识。

Electronic (电子的)：这个词指的是与电子技术有关的事物。它包括电子设备、电子电路、计算机、通信设备等，强调了电子技术的应用和电子元件的使用。"Electronic" 用于描述使用电子器件和技术的物品或系统。

总之，"electric" 是与电力本身有关的词，而 "electronic" 是与电子技术和电子器件有关的词。


## specific, special, certain, specified, particular
