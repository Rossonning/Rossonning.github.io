## Suggestion letter

### Improve college cafeteria

> You eat at your college cafeteria every lunchtime. However, you think it needs some improvements. Write a letter to the college magazine. In your letter,
>
> - explain what you like about the cafeteria
> - Say what is wrong with it
> - Suggest how it could be improved

Dear Editor,

I hope this letter finds you well.  I am writing to propose potential improvements(modifications/refinements/enhancements) **for** our college cafeteria. While the cafeteria is already a popular choice among students, I believe a few modifications could **further** elevate its appeal and **functionality**.

**One of the aspects** that I admire about the cafeteria is its prime location **within** our campus. This central placement makes it convenient for **a multitude of(numerous/a large number of/a wide range of/a variety of)** students, including me, to enjoy our lunches there. The cozy ambiance created by its warm and well-designed decor enhances the overall dining experience. Additionally, the cafeteria's diverse menu **caters to(appeals to/accommodates)** a wide(extensive/broad) array(range) of tastes, ensuring that there's something for everyone.

However, there are certain aspects(areas/elements) that could be addressed(**It's worth noting** certain factors that could be **worked on**.). Firstly, the cafeteria's **operating hours** are **somewhat** limited. Extending the hours, perhaps until 8 pm, would accommodate students with evening classes and provide a **gathering spot** for those **seeking a coffee** or a light meal after their courses. Secondly, the lack of sufficient parking space for bicycles is a **recurring** issue. I suggest repurposing some of the available area near the **entrance** to create **designated** bike parking spaces.

I hope these suggestions are taken into serious consideration. Your attention to these matters is greatly appreciated, and I look forward to any possible improvements that might enhance our cafeteria experience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

---

Dear Editor,

I am writing to **share my thoughts about** our college cafeteria, hoping to contribute to the ongoing discussions on improving our campus environment. While the cafeteria serves as a vital hub for students during lunchtime, there are aspects that **warrant** attention for enhancing the overall experience.

Firstly, I appreciate the convenience and variety offered by the cafeteria's menu. The range of options caters to different(diverse) tastes and **dietary preferences**, making it accessible to a diverse student body. Moreover, the central location of the cafeteria fosters social interactions, allowing students to connect and share their daily experiences.

However, there are areas that require attention for improvement. The limited(restricted/constrained/confined) **seating capacity** often results in overcrowding **during peak hours(during the busiest hours/during busy periods/times)**, leading to **discomfort** and reduced relaxation. Additionally, the speed of service can be inconsistent, causing **long waiting times** that **cut into(eat into/diminish/reduce/infringe upon)** our already limited break.

To address these issues, I suggest implementing a few improvements. Expanding the seating area or creating additional dining spaces would **alleviate** congestion(overcrowding) and provide a more comfortable environment. Moreover, introducing a **pre-order** system through a **dedicated** mobile app could **streamline** service, reducing waiting times and enhancing efficiency.

In conclusion, the college cafeteria is a fundamental part of our campus life, and with some strategic enhancements, it can further contribute to a positive student experience. I believe these suggestions could bring about positive changes that would benefit the entire student body.

**Thank you for considering my input.**

### New Airport

> You recently discovered that there are plans to build a new airport in your area and you are not happy with it. Write a letter to the local authority. In your letter,
>
> - Say how you found out about the plans
> - Explain what problems your neighborhood will face
> - Suggest some possible solutions to those problems.

Dear authority,

I am writing to ***express my deep concern regarding*** the recently(newly) announced(proposed) plans for constructing a new airport ***within*** our district. 

I ***came across*** this information last week while listening to a local radio channel, and I feel ***compelled*** to address the potential ***adverse*** repercussions(***consequences/implications***/impacts) that this project might bring to our neighborhood.

I believe the airport occupies too much land that ***could have been originally*** used for common purposes, such as a shopping mall, hospital, and park. These amenities have the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for the ***surrounding*** residents and enhance employment opportunities in the locality. When compared to the limited benefits that the airport would bring to us, it becomes apparent that this situation is unjust for the community. 

(Moreover, the ***extensive*** land allocation for the airport ***raises questions about*** the judicious use of valuable space. This land, which could otherwise be utilized for community-enhancing amenities like shopping malls, hospitals, and parks, has the potential to significantly elevate the overall quality of life for local residents and ***bolster*** employment opportunities in the ***vicinity***. ***In contrast***, the ***anticipated*** benefits of the airport ***appear*** limited ***in comparison to*** the negative impacts it might generate.)

I would like to suggest reducing airport's size and relocating it ***to the far side***, thus the noise influence could be well controlled and space at the close side could be developed to mall, which can both serve passengers and local citizens. 

(I would like to ***propose*** an alternative solution that ***involves downsizing*** the airport and relocating it to a more remote location. By implementing this approach, the adverse noise effects could be effectively ***mitigated***, while the ***vacated*** space in close ***proximity*** could be ***optimally*** repurposed for the benefit of both ***passengers*** and local ***inhabitants***.)

I would be greatly appreciate it if you could treat this issue seriously, I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
(I sincerely hope that you will give ***earnest*** consideration to this matter. Your thoughtful attention to these concerns would be highly appreciated. I eagerly anticipate your response.)

## Expressing concern

###  Sent docs lost
> You recently sent some documents by post, but they did not arrive. Write a letter to the post manager. In your letter
>
> - Give details of the situation
> - Describe the documents
> - Say what action you want the post office to take.

I am writing to **address an issue** that has **left me quite concerned**. A recent shipment of documents I sent via post has not yet reached(arrived at) its **intended(designated/proposed/planned/expected)** destination.

The documents were well-packaged and **dispatched** last Wednesday from a local post office. They **consist of** **a set of** legal papers related to my banking business, making them **of significant value** in terms of personal and legal importance. Despite the assurance provided by the postal service, I **regret to** (I am disappointed to) inform you that I have received no confirmation of their safe arrival.

I kindly request that you investigate this matter promptly.(I kindly request a prompt investigation into this matter.) Since the documents are time-sensitive and **hold high significance for both parties involved**, tracing the **whereabouts[u]** of the package and ensuring its swift delivery to its originally intended **recipient** is my **resolute demand**. I would greatly appreciate it if you could **keep me informed about** the **updated status** of my package **during the forthcoming(upcoming/approaching) delivery**.

I trust that my requests will receive serious and immediate attention. Please feel free to **reach out to me** if any further information is needed.

### Share dormitory
> You live in a room in college which you share with another student. However, there are many problems with this arrangement and you find it very difficult to work. Write a letter to the accommodation officer at the college. In the letter,
>
> - describe the situation
> - explain your problems and why it is difficult to work
> - say what kind of accommodation you would prefer

Dear Accommodation Officer,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to address the challenges(hurdles) I am facing with my current living situation in the college dormitory. I share a room with a fellow student, and unfortunately, this arrangement ***has proven to be quite problematic for various reasons***.

***To elaborate(To be specific)***, my roommate and I have vastly different schedules. While I prioritize my studies during the evening, my roommate often returns late at night and engages in activities that create noise, making it ***exceedingly*** difficult for me to concentrate. As a result, my productivity has suffered, and I find it increasingly hard to maintain a ***conducive*** environment for academic work.

Furthermore, my roommate's lack of consideration for others has added to the predicament. Frequent loud music and disruptive behavior have hindered not only my work but also my overall well-being. Despite my attempts to address these concerns through open communication, there has been no noticeable improvement.

In light of these challenges, I kindly request a room change. I would greatly appreciate a quieter living environment with a roommate who shares similar study habits. If possible, a room closer to the central library would be highly beneficial for my academic pursuits.

I understand that accommodation options may be limited, and I am open to any suitable arrangement that can enhance my study experience. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

### Lost item on a train
> You have lost an item of value on a train. Write a letter to the railway company. In your letter,
> 
> - describe the item
> - explain where and when you left it
> - say what action you would like the company to take

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to inform you about(report you) the loss of my wallet on one of your trains yesterday evening. The wallet is brown leather with brass(silver/gold) decorations on the surface. It contains my ID card, several credit cards, and some cash, although I cannot ***specify the exact amount***.

I believe I left my wallet on the train when I hurriedly(hastily) ***disembarked*** after being ***awakened*** by a notification on my smartphone. This happened at around(approximately) 8:30 PM at the City Central station. I ***suspect(guess)*** the wallet ***slipped out of*** my jeans pocket and was left on the seat.

I ***kindly*** request your assistance in locating and returning my lost wallet. I have provided the station name and the ***exact*** time of the incident. I am more than willing to provide any additional information needed to aid in the search, such as a detailed description of the lost items and my contact information.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could ***treat this matter with urgency***, as the items in the wallet ***are essential for my daily life***. Your ***prompt*** action would be highly valued.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I eagerly await your response.

## Expressing satisfaction

### Appreciate Restaurant

> You and some friends ate a meal at a restaurant to celebrate a special occasion, and you were very pleased with the food and services. Write a letter to the restaurant manager. In your letter,

> - Say what was good about the food and the services

Dear [Restaurant Manager's Name],

# Practice - Task 2



## Type: Why and stance

### Template

Nowadays, a significant number of `group` dedicate prolonged hours each day to `topic`. From my perspective, this phenomenon can be attributed to a combination of factors, including `...` 

Turning to the question whether this trend signifies a constructive or destructive development, my stance leans towards the latter for several compelling reasons.

"In conclusion, while there may be some `merits` to `choosing` plan A, plan B leads to a more stable and assured world."

### Smart phone

> Some children spend hours every day on their smartphones.
>
> Why is this the case? Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?
>
> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

In today's society, a significant number of children **dedicate** several hours each day **to** their smartphones. From my perspective, this trend can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the widespread **availability** of smartphones, the allure of **digital entertainment**, and the need for connectivity in a technology-driven world. Youngsters **are drawn to** the captivating features of smartphones, such as gaming, social media, and **instant messaging**.

Turning to the question whether this trend signifies a positive or negative development, my stance leans towards the latter for some compelling reasons.

Firstly, excessive smartphone use can adversely affect children's physical health. **Prolonged screen time** **is linked to** visual **impairment** and **posture-related issues** like **neck strain**. For instance, **studies have shown** a rise in **myopia** among children who spend **substantial** time **engrossed** in smartphone activities.

Furthermore, the **immersion** in smartphones hinders **educational and personal development**. **Valuable time that could be dedicated to** learning or engaging in physical activities **is diverted towards** endless **scrolling** and virtual interactions. This can **hinder** cognitive development and limit real-world experiences essential for well-rounded growth.

Additionally, the **prevalence** of social media apps on smartphones **exposes** children **to** potential online dangers. Cyberbullying, identity theft, and inappropriate content are **lurking** threats that can negatively impact their mental well-being and emotional development.

In conclusion, while smartphones offer undeniable conveniences, the excessive **usage** among children poses significant challenges. The **adverse** effects on health, education, and **safety** make it clear that this trend **is more of a negative development than a positive one**.

---

Nowadays, the youth spend a considerable amount of time on their smartphones. In my understanding, this widespread phenomenon can be attributed to human nature's tendency to seek novel experiences and engage in interactions with others. Consequently, device producers and app development teams leverage this inclination to stimulate demand for advanced smartphones and various apps, thereby boosting their sales and revenue.

Turning to the question of whether this trend signifies a positive or negative development, my stance leans towards the latter for several compelling reasons.

Firstly, prolonged use of smartphones can be **detrimental** to children's health. Driven by the wide range of appealing content available on smartphones, people are prone to becoming immersed and ignoring the need for rest, inadvertently leading to damage to their eyes and necks.

Additionally, excessive dependence on smartphones affects youngsters' personal growth. It has been proven that students struggle to strike a balance between relaxation and **overuse** of their electronic devices. Immersing in the virtual world **distracts** them from **their** studies and physical activities, ultimately resulting in failures in **subsequent** competition with their peers.

Lastly, adolescents are vulnerable to being misled and cheated by information accessed via smartphones. As technology evolves, online criminals targeting young generations thrive and cause significant repercussions. It is difficult to address this issue solely through the efforts of the police and society. The ideal and efficient approach is to prevent such hazards in the first place.

In conclusion, while smartphones allow children to broaden their horizons by exposing them to a wider world, the underlying threats to their security and growth bear far-reaching negative consequences.



### New products emphasized in Ads

> In their advertising, businesses nowadays usually emphasize that their products are new in some way.
>
> Why is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?
>
> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

In contemporary advertising, businesses often focus on **highlighting** the **newness** of their products. **In my understanding**, this common practice can be attributed to **human nature's tendency** to seek novel experiences and engage in **competitive comparisons**. Consequently, companies leverage this **inclination** to **stimulate demand for** new products, thereby **boosting** their sales and revenue.

**Turning to the question of whether** this trend signifies a positive or negative development, my stance leans towards the latter for several compelling reasons.

Firstly, emphasizing **novelty** often **prompts** customers to acquire unnecessary products and services. Driven by the **allure** of newness, people are prone to ignore their actual needs and **cost a fortune for** features they actually don't need. Furthermore, this inappropriate emphasis impedes the audience's ability to gather sufficient product information from the advertisement, **thereby(thus)** also affecting the shopping experience of users with **genuine** purchasing needs.

Moreover, the **relentless(continuous)** pursuit of turnover can lead to products with shorter **lifespans**. **As companies aim for** customers to upgrade their products periodically, **durability** is no longer a primary consideration in product design and manufacturing. Some even **propose(advocate)** a design concept where products are **intentionally(deliberately)** rendered **obsolete** within a certain **time frame(duration)** to encourage consumers to **switch to the next generation of products.**

Lastly, the continuous introduction of new products and the **discarding** of older ones exacerbates environmental concerns. This cycle **escalates** production, packaging, and **disposal-related** environmental impacts, further **straining** limited resources and polluting ecosystems.

In conclusion, while marketing products as novel may yield short-term gains for businesses, the underlying culture of excessive consumerism bears far-reaching negative consequences.

### Taking risks

> It is important for people to take risks, both in their professional lives and their personal lives.
>
> Do you think the advantages of taking risks outweigh the disadvantages?
>
> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

In the ongoing debate about risk-taking, there are differing views on whether this behavioral pattern benefits people in **their daily lives** and workplaces or leads to more negative consequences. My stance leans towards the former for some compelling reasons.

Firstly, **adhering to** one's inherent traits makes life simpler. As a renowned economist once said, a reasonable person naturally avoids taking risks. I believe prudence is a lesson humans have learned through long-term evolution, which **prompts** us **to** protect ourselves **in the face of** appealing but inherently dangerous situations, ensuring our survival in the natural environment.

Additionally, avoiding risks can guarantee steady outcomes **in the long term**. A conservative strategy is widely **employed** in diverse fields, including making military decisions, determining investment **portfolios**, and applying for mutually exclusive positions. This approach **has been proven to be** effective. As a prominent stock market expert **remarked**, selecting a predictable corporation and being patient over time are key.

Lastly, taking risks can easily **transform into** gambling. For the majority, it is challenging to **assess** whether **things are under control**. When **confronted with** games of probability, as **emotional beings**, humans often fail and lose everything due to instincts like fear, anger, and recklessness. The best way to avoid **such a tragedy** is to **refrain from participating**.

In conclusion, while there may be some benefits to being a **bold** decision-maker, maintaining a conservative and prudent attitude toward everything ensures a stable and **assured** life.

The debate over the significance of risk-taking in both professional and personal domains is ongoing. While some advocate the potential benefits of **embracing** risk, I believe the drawbacks tend to outweigh the advantages for several reasons.

Firstly, individuals often **underestimate** the potential consequences of failed **ventures**. The **aftermath** of a risk **gone wrong** can be **far-reaching**, affecting not only the individual's well-being but also their **surroundings**. For instance, a business decision to invest heavily in a **speculative** project can lead to financial **turmoil** not only for the entrepreneur but also for their employees and stakeholders.

Secondly, **proven** strategies across diverse fields consistently show that **conservative approaches yield stable returns in the long run**. **Whether** in financial investments, medical treatments, or technological innovations, a **cautious** and **calculated** approach has historically ensured better outcomes. This has been particularly evident **in the case of** sustainable investment practices, where avoiding excessive risk-taking **aligns with** the principle of gradual yet secure growth.

Lastly, **human beings** often struggle to **strike the right balance between** calculated risk and **recklessness**. What begins as a well-calibrated **endeavor** can quickly **devolve into** uncontrollable gambling. This can result in severe **losses**, eroding not just one's resources but also their self-confidence and motivation.

In conclusion, while taking risks may have certain merits, the **potential adverse consequences**, including the underestimation of failure's aftermath and the propensity for risk to **escalate into** uncontrolled gambling, emphasize that the disadvantages of embracing risks tend to **overshadow** the benefits.

### Aging society

> In many countries, people are now living longer than ever before. Some people say an ageing population creates problems for governments. Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people.
>
> To what extent do the advantages of having an ageing population outweigh the disadvantages?
>
> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

In the ongoing debate regarding an aging society, there are differing views on whether it **presents** a wide range of challenges to governments or has some merits due to the existence of older individuals. My perspective leans towards the former for several reasons.

Firstly, a substantial population of elderly people inevitably results in significant societal costs. **From an economic standpoint**, the productivity of senior citizens diminishes, while the **demand for** more resources to **care for** them increases. They are more **susceptible** to diseases and require treatments and nursing services, resulting in substantial medical **expenses borne** by public finances. Moreover, **in comparison to** the youth, the older population **has adapted to** a relatively higher living standard, making it quite expensive to **sustain** their **adjusted** lifestyle.

Additionally, the aging workforce **hampers** the development and **proactiveness** of the younger generation. Many major companies are solely **dominated** by senior members. While these individuals made **noteworthy** contributions to their companies in past years, they are now **hesitant to**  relinquish power and promote younger **successors**. Due to the lack of fresh insights and passion, these renowned corporations are starting to lose their competitive advantages and **market share**, eventually being replaced by those who regularly evolve their decision-making teams.

Lastly, the **enduring** impact of an unhealthy population structure is undeniable. Population evolution is a **gradual** process that is challenging to influence through short-term policies. Correcting an **imbalanced** population structure often requires efforts **spanning** several generations and significant costs from various fields. All of these resources could have been allocated to more meaningful purposes, rather than merely addressing population **distribution**.

In conclusion, while a substantial population of older individuals can contribute their experiences and advice to society, a balanced population distribution seems to offer more benefits in the long run.

The increasing longevity of individuals in numerous nations has sparked a debate about the **repercussions** of an ageing population on governments. While some argue that this trend **poses challenges**, others contend that it offers benefits. In my view, the disadvantages of having an ageing population outweigh the advantages due to several compelling reasons.

Firstly, an older population **places a burden on** healthcare systems and pension **schemes**. As people age, they tend to require more **medical attention** and support, **straining** the healthcare infrastructure. Additionally, governments need to allocate **a significant portion of** their budgets to pension payments, **diverting funds from** other crucial areas such as education and infrastructure development.

Moreover, **a decline in** the **workforce** productivity **arises from** an ageing population. With **a smaller proportion of** young people entering the job market, there could be **shortages in** skilled labor, hindering economic growth and innovation. This **demographic** shift could also result in increased dependency ratios, where a smaller working-age population supports a larger elderly population, leading to a potential strain on social services.

Furthermore, an ageing population can lead to **declining** economic competitiveness. Countries with a disproportionately older population might struggle to **keep pace with** rapidly evolving industries and technologies, affecting their ability to remain globally competitive.

In conclusion, **while there may be some benefits to** having an ageing population, such as the accumulation of **wisdom** and experience, the **associated** disadvantages, including economic strain and decreased productivity, are more substantial. Governments should carefully consider the challenges posed by this demographic trend and **formulate policies** to address them effectively.

### Interdisciplinary and time management  

> Some university students want to learn about other subjects in addition to their main subjects. Others believe it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for a qualification.
>
> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

In the ongoing debate over learning strategy at college, while some advocate for a comprehensive understanding of a wide range of **disciplines**, my stance leans towards focusing **exclusively** on their original subject.

Firstly, **dedicating** more efforts to the designated subject allows for the optimal utilization of academic resources. **Unlike** primary education, university aims to develop(cultivate) one's **in-depth** insights and a critical mindset. Within the  original department and subject, students can **access** renowned professors **in** their **field** and have opportunities to verify their ideas using specific amenities provided by college. Both of which may appear luxurious to those outside the unisversity environment, making it compelling for students to fully utilize these time-limited **privileges**.

Moreover, blindly delving into interdisciplinary studying could lead to unpredictable outcomes. Without the well-devised curriculum and guidence **available** within the main subject, Youngsters are prone to **getting lost** in non-targeted efforts. Additionally, since they don't have a general idea of foundations of other subjects, it is difficult for them to establish a well-structured recognition and determine the order of learning different courses. All of these factors make the studying process struggling and hard to assess outcomes, and eventually results in a lack of achievement.

Lastly, becoming a proficient expert in one's main subject enhances competitiveness as they enter society. In today's world, graduates of higher education **are seen as** a significant source of recruitment for many major companies. These companies offer a variety of positions that demand **expertise** and skills in specific areas. Students with **relevant majors** are more likely to **secure** jobs. If students could anticipate the job market's demands, they would be more motivated to **invest** additional **effort in** obtaining the necessary qualifications.

In conclusion, immersing oneself in specific major courses is a prudent and effective approach for college students, benefiting their personal development and future prospects after graduation.

---

In the ongoing discussion surrounding university education, **there are differing views on whether** students should **diversify** their studies or focus **solely** on their primary subject. My perspective leans towards **the latter** for several reasons.

Firstly, **dedicating** significant **effort to** one's chosen field **maximizes the use of** academic resources. Unlike primary education, where a broad foundation is essential, university aims to cultivate in-depth insights and critical thinking. **Engaging deeply within the department** allows students to access renowned professors, validating ideas using specialized resources. These **privileges** are often seen as luxuries, making their effective utilization imperative.

Additionally, delving into multiple disciplines can be challenging to ensure predictable outcomes. The absence of a well-structured curriculum within the primary subject can lead students **astray** in non-targeted pursuits. Furthermore, lacking a solid foundation in other fields hinders proper recognition and sequencing of courses. This complexity **hampers** effective learning and assessment, **ultimately** results in inadequate achievements.

Lastly, **specialization** enhances **competitiveness** in the job market. In the modern world, higher education graduates **are highly regarded by** major companies. These corporations require expertise in specific areas for various roles. Students with relevant majors are better positioned to secure such positions. If students can anticipate market demands, they can invest more effort in gaining the required qualifications.

In conclusion, while exposure to various subjects has its merits, a focused approach within one's main subject appears more beneficial. This strategy optimizes resources, minimizes learning complications, and increases post-graduation prospects.

>
> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

**It is widely asserted** that the primary objective of scientific development should the enhancement of overall societal well-being. I completely **endorse** this perspective for several compelling reasons.

Firstly, a considerable portion of public resources is invested into(**channeled into**) scientific research. For example, the majority of academic institutions are more or less sponsored by public funding. Universities can often obtain land **at favorable rates** for educational purposes(**use**), and a **generous** subsidies, borne by governments, is **allocated to** cover living costs of researchers. All of these privileges **are aimed at** building a dedicated environment for for those engaged in scientific endeavors. Consequently, it is justified for society to **expect** **tangible** returns on its enormous investment.

Additionally, improved living standards can, in turn, prompt technological advancements. Humans are **inherently** driven by pursuit of better material conditions. People can **harness** their highest levels of(**maximal**) motivation to **delve into** ways of increasing productivity. This passion, in most cases, continuously leads to remarkable scientific **breakthroughs**.

Lastly, ensuring that scientific explorations are **conducted** for positive purposes **mitigates** underlying hazards. Proven practices across diverse fields consistently **illustrate** that the aftermath of **misuse** of technology and **unethical** research could be extremely devastating. Instances such as the **deployment** of chemical and biological weapons on battlefields and **unregulated** overuse of cloning. Given all these tragedies, it is definitely **warranted** to set the right direction for scientific **inquiry**.

In conclusion, while there might be some advantages to **diversify** the goals of scientific activities, I firmly contend that prioritizing the **amelioration[u]** of living conditions for the majority ultimately leads to an efficient and assured society.



### Keep life tidy (13-3)

> Some people say it is important to keep your home and your workplace tidy, with everything organized and in the correct place. 
>
> What is your opinion about this?

In the ongoing discourse surrounding the importance of maintaining a clean and organized living and working environment, my stance strongly advocates for its significance. Although some may perceive such persistance as time-consuming, I firmly believe that the benefits it brings are substantial and **far-reaching**.

First and foremost, upholding a tidy living space greatly contributes to one's **physical and mental well-being**. Regular **upkeep** not only provides residents with a comfortable and enjoyable **habitat** but also alleviates stress. Conversely, an **unkempt** environment fosters the **proliferation** of harmful bacteria and parasites, leading to a host of health **ailments**. Furthermore, residing in a **cluttered** setting over a prolonged period can negatively impact one's mood and mental health.

Moreover, maintaining a well-organized workplace **serves as a testament to** an individual's professionalism. While **it might seem like a stereotype**, there exists a **societal perception** that those who **consistently** place their belongings in designated **spots** are often deemed reliable and **dedicated**. This notion is grounded in practicality, as such behavior **indicates(signifies)** a strong **work ethic** and a **commitment to efficiency**, ***both of which*** are highly valued in any professional setting.

Lastly, the practice of tidiness fosters positive interactions with others. While some individuals might **overlook** personal **hygiene**, most people **appreciate** sharing living or working spaces with those who prioritize **cleanliness**. A **neat** and orderly environment enhances the overall ambiance and fosters **a sense of respect and cooperation** among individuals.

In conclusion, maintaining a clean and organized living and working environment **reaps** numerous benefits. It positively impacts physical health, **signifies** professionalism, and fosters harmonious interactions. Therefore, I firmly believe that the effort invested in ensuring cleanliness is a worthwhile endeavor that contributes to overall well-being and productivity.



### Leisure activities & work

In the contemporary world, a significant portion of individuals is caught up in the ***vortex*** of long working hours, leaving only ***scant*** time for leisure pursuits. While this phenomenon is often deemed(perceived) as a mark(sign) of commitment(dedication) and ambition, its disadvantages are undoubtedly(unquestionably) more profound and impactful. (While there may be some benefits to extended work hours, the drawbacks are undeniably ***substantial***, making the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.)

To begin with, The toll it takes on an individual's well-being(health) is a prominent drawback. Prolonged periods of work without ***adequate*** rest can lead to burnout, stress, and even serious health issues. ***Studies have shown that*** individuals who consistently work long hours ***are more prone to*** conditions such as anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular diseases. It's ***imperative*** to recognize(realize) that personal wellness serves as the foundation for ***sustained*** career growth and overall life ***satisfaction(contentment)***.

Moreover, leisure activities play a pivotal role in personal growth and development. Engaging in(Participating in) hobbies, sports, or spending quality time with loved ones fosters creativity, enhances cognitive abilities, and promotes emotional well-being. For instance, people who ***pursue*** painting in their free time may find that their creativity ***spills over into*** their work, resulting in innovative problem-solving and fresh perspectives.

Furthermore, the misconception that longer working hours ***translate into*** higher career achievements is ***questionable***. Research has shown that excessive work hours can lead to diminishing returns as fatigue ***sets in***, decreasing productivity and ***impeding*** creativity. ***Conversely***, a well-balanced lifestyle encourages individuals to work more efficiently, make better use of their time, and maintain a higher level of engagement and motivation.

 It is essential(crucial) for individuals and organizations ***alike*** to realize the importance of work-life balance and prioritize the holistic well-being of employees. Only through a harmonious integration of work and leisure can individuals achieve ***genuine*** satisfaction and contribute meaningfully to their personal and professional ***spheres***.


### Housing requirement & countryside spaces
> **Prompt:** 
>
> In many places, new homes are needed, but the only space available for building them is in the countryside. Some people believe it is more important to protect the countryside and not build new homes there.
>
> What is your opinion about this?

In the ongoing ***debate*** about whether to construct new homes in rural areas or preserve the countryside, my view ***leans toward*** the significance of accommodating the ***pressing(urgent) need*** for new housing. While I acknowledge the value of safeguarding the natural environment, several factors ***compel*** me to prioritize the creation of new dwellings.

Firstly, the demand for housing is an urgent concern in many places. Rapid urbanization, population growth, and migration to cities have contributed to a shortage of suitable shelters. This habitation ***insufficiency(Scarcity/Lack/Deficiency)*** can lead to rising homelessness and unaffordable living conditions, especially for low-income families and individuals. Constructing homes in the countryside could provide a ***viable*** solution to address this issue and ensure that people have access to safe and comfortable ***living spaces(quarters)***.

Secondly, the development of new homes in countryside can be undertaken with responsible planning and sustainable practices. Modern architectural techniques and eco-friendly designs can minimize the environmental impact of construction. ***Adhering to*** strict regulations and incorporating green design principles, new ***residence*** projects can be executed without ***compromising*** the beauty and ecological balance of the countryside. Furthermore, integrating green spaces and preserving natural elements within newly built residential areas can contribute to a harmonious ***coexistence*** between urbanization and nature.

Lastly, the establishment of fresh residences in ***rustic areas*** can lead to economic growth and enhanced ***community infrastructure***. The building sector generates jobs and economic activity, benefiting both local economies and national development. Moreover, new housing projects often come with the expansion of essential facilities such as schools, healthcare centers, and transportation networks. This, ***in turn***, improves the overall quality of life in both urban and rural areas.

In conclusion, while the protection of the countryside is a valid concern, the urgent need for new housing should ***take precedence***. Responsible urban planning and sustainable building practices can enable us to meet the housing demand without ***irreparably*** harming the environment. A balanced approach that accommodates both housing needs and environmental preservation is vital for the well-being of society as a whole.


### Online shopping closing
> **Prompt:** 
>
> The growth of online shopping will one day lead to all shops in towns and cities closing.
> 
> Do you agree or disagree? 
> 
> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

The prevalence of online shopping has ***undeniably*** transformed the retail ***panorama***, but the ***assertion*** that all physical shops will eventually close in towns and cities seems overly ***speculative***. While online shopping offers unparalleled convenience, there are compelling reasons to believe that traditional ***brick-and-mortar*** stores will persist.

Firstly, physical shops provide a ***tangible*** shopping experience that online platforms can't replicate. ***Shoppers*** often desire the opportunity to touch, feel, and test products before purchasing, particularly for items like clothing and furniture. For instance, selecting the perfect ***outfit*** or ***assessing the comfort of*** a sofa is ***best done*** in person. Furthermore, certain products such as fresh groceries or fragile items are more suited for in-store purchases, where customers can ***inspect*** the quality and ***ensure proper handling***.

***Another factor to consider*** is the ***immediate gratification*** of taking purchases home ***promptly***. While online shopping offers convenience, it can't match the satisfaction of directly possessing an item. This ***swift*** access appeals to consumers who value ***instant rewards*** and may not want to wait for delivery.

Additionally, physical stores play a vital role in ***brand loyalty*** and ***customer engagement***. Many ***big brands*** view their stores as key ***touchpoints*** where customers can interact with products and receive ***personalized assistance***. These stores contribute to brand identity and offer a chance for companies to establish strong emotional connections with their customers.

In conclusion, the growth of online shopping will ***undoubtedly*** continue to reshape the retail ***industry***. However, the complete closure of all physical shops in towns and cities is unlikely. The tactile shopping experience, immediate satisfaction, and importance of physical stores for brand loyalty suggest that both online and offline shopping ***avenues*** will ***coexist*** in the future retail landscape.


### Government Control of Population 
> **Prompt:** 
> 
> Some governments say how many children a family can have in their country. They may control the number of children someone has through taxes. It is sometimes necessary and right for a government to control the population in this way.
>
> Do you agree or disagree ? 
>
> Give reasons for your answer.

I strongly disagree with the idea of governments controlling the number of children a family can have through taxes or any other coercive measures. While population management may be a concern, ***such practices raise significant ethical and practical issues***.

Firstly, imposing restrictions on family size ***infringes upon*** individual freedom and ***personal autonomy***. Family planning decisions ***should remain a private matter***, allowing individuals to make choices that ***best align with*** their values, beliefs, and circumstances. Government ***interference*** in this deeply personal aspect of life ***undermines basic human rights***.

Secondly, ***coercive*** measures such as taxes can be ineffective and ***counterproductive***. Instead of ***curbing*** population growth, ***they may lead to unintended consequences***. For instance, families facing economic hardship might choose to ***evade taxes*** or ***resort to*** unsafe ***abortion*** practices, ***endangering both their health and society at large***.

Lastly, focusing solely on population control through taxes ***overlooks the root causes of*** overpopulation. Governments should address the ***underlying factors***, such as lack of access to education, healthcare, and family planning resources. Investing in comprehensive ***reproductive health services*** and educational programs ***empowers*** individuals to ***make informed choices*** and naturally leads to more sustainable population growth.

In conclusion, while population management is an important consideration for governments, it should not be achieved through coercive measures like controlling family size through taxes. Such practices infringe on personal autonomy, have unintended consequences, and fail to address the underlying issues. Instead, fostering access to education, healthcare, and family planning resources empowers individuals to make responsible choices and ensures a more sustainable approach to population control.


### The Educational Value of Children's Leisure Activities

> **Prompt:**
> 
> Some people believe that children's leisure activities must be educational; otherwise, they are a complete waste of time.
>
> Do you agree or disagree?
> 
> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your experience.

I completely disagree with the ***notion*** that children's leisure activities must be ***exclusively*** educational to be worthwhile. While education is crucial, children can learn valuable life lessons and skills from a diverse range of activities if guided effectively.

Firstly, the definition of "educational" is subjective and ***can encompass various forms of learning***. For instance, engaging in team sports teaches children about cooperation, discipline, and leadership, which are essential life skills. Similarly, participating in creative pursuits like drawing or writing ***nurtures*** imagination and self-expression, promoting cognitive and emotional development.

Secondly, many beneficial traits and abilities cannot be learned through ***explicit educational objectives***. For instance, engaging in outdoor activities like camping or hiking fosters ***resilience***, problem-solving, and ***adaptability***, which are essential for personal growth. Moreover, spending time with family and friends during leisure activities ***cultivates*** social skills, empathy, and ***emotional intelligence***.

Lastly, striking a balance between educational and non-educational activities is crucial for a child's overall development. ***Excessive focus on*** academic pursuits can lead to ***burnout*** and ***hinder*** the child's creative and emotional growth. Having hobbies and pursuing leisure activities not only provides a ***much-needed*** break from academic pressures but also ***instills*** a lifelong love for learning and exploration.

From personal experience, my younger brother developed excellent teamwork and leadership skills by participating in a local youth club's drama performances. Although not explicitly educational, the experience taught him the importance of cooperation and time management, which later proved invaluable in his academic and professional ***endeavors***.

In conclusion, children's leisure activities should not be limited to being strictly educational. ***A well-rounded approach*** to leisure pursuits allows children to learn diverse skills, foster personal growth, and ***develop a passion for*** lifelong learning. Striking a balance between education and leisure is vital in shaping well-rounded individuals who can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.

Nowadays, `phenomenon` has become a prevalent concern among `fork`, leading to a wide array of health issues. This essay will explore the reasons behind this issue and propose viable solutions to address it.

In contemporary society, it is increasingly common to observe individuals deeply engrossed in researching the history of their residences. This essay will delve into the underlying reasons behind this phenomenon and propose a range of viable research approaches.

### Tracing residence

> In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

> What are the reasons for this?

> How can people research this?


In contemporary society, it is increasingly common to observe individuals deeply engrossed in researching the history of their residences. This essay will delve into the underlying reasons behind this phenomenon and propose a range of viable research approaches.

One primary explanation for this trend is the universal desire to establish a sense of belonging. In contrast to the relatively short lifespans of current residents, many houses have stood for centuries, bearing witness to the evolving stories of countless families. These architectural relics serve as repositories of shared memories, passing down familial legacies to successive generations. In essence, these historical homes function as collective family diaries, enabling descendants to forge meaningful connections with their ancestors by revisiting the experiences embedded in their old houses.

Furthermore, this burgeoning interest is partly fueled by a heightened awareness of the importance of preserving history. Architecture, often regarded as a form of art, provides valuable insights into the cultural and aesthetic preferences of bygone eras. Widespread inquiries into historical buildings serve not only to identify those with exceptional historical value but also to ensure their robust preservation for posterity.

To facilitate the realization of these objectives, a collaborative effort between residents and society at large is essential. For instance, local libraries can take the initiative to systematically categorize and maintain records of local buildings. This organized database would greatly assist individuals seeking information about the history of their residences. Additionally, recognizing that preserving historical residences can be financially challenging for ordinary citizens, the government could establish specific funding programs to subsidize these costs, thereby encouraging more extensive preservation efforts.

In conclusion, the fervor for researching the histories of residences can be attributed to both personal and societal factors. Although this endeavor may seem daunting, requiring expertise and time, it can be effectively addressed through collaborative efforts within communities. By doing so, we not only honor our past but also enrich our present and future by connecting with the stories etched into the walls of our historical homes.



### Insufficient exercise (13-2)

> Many working people get little or no exercise either during the working day or in their free time, and have health problems as a result.
> 
> Why do many working people not get enough exercise? What can be done about this problem?

Insufficient physical activity has become a **prevalent(prevailing)** concern among the **workforce**, leading to a myriad of health issues. This phenomenon is **propelled** by a combination(convergence) of factors.

(With the evolution of contemporary work environments, a growing number of individuals find themselves caught in a cycle of limited physical activity. This transformation is a culmination of various factors, and while the restoration of a more active lifestyle may appear challenging, viable strategies do exist to revitalize physical engagement.)

Foremost, the contemporary work culture often enforces long(**extended**) working hours, with(driven by) the misguided notion that extended(**prolonged**) time equates to increased productivity. This prevailing mindset **compels** many individuals, particularly the younger generation, to willingly **sacrifice** their leisure moments, including those intended for **physical fitness**, **in pursuit of** professional success.

Furthermore, the **relentless** march of technological progress, designed(designated) to offer relaxation from work, *inadvertently* detracts from physical activities. The *allure* of social media, online gaming, and streaming platforms captivates(captures) people, **diverting(drawing) their time away from** potential exercise opportunities such as **gym sessions**, swimming, and outdoor sports.

While **instigating** a societal shift towards recognizing the importance of regular exercise might initially seem **daunting(challenging)**, there are viable strategies to prompt change. **Official acknowledgment** and correction of the overtime **fallacy(misconception)** are pivotal in promoting work-life balance, enabling individuals to **carve out(allocate)** dedicated time for exercise. Establishing a **corporate ethos** that values both physical and mental well-being can be instrumental in shifting priorities.

Additionally, **leveraging(harnessing/utilizing/Making effective use of)** technology for positive purposes is crucial. The promotion of health and fitness applications can **raise awareness** about the significance of self-monitoring and **adhering to** scientifically **endorsed** exercise regimens.

In conclusion, the **dearth** of exercise among the working population **stems from(due to/ is linked to/ can be attributed tp)** demanding jobs, sedentary leisure preferences, (and limited access to exercise facilities). Tackling this issue necessitates collaborative efforts between employers, governments, and individuals(**a multifaceted(comprehensive/ well-rounded) approach(strategy/ plan) involving** employers, **governments**, and individuals is necessary.). Encouraging movement during work hours, promoting(advocating for) outdoor leisure pursuits, and enhancing access to **recreational spaces** are vital steps towards a healthier and more active society.

> It is generally accepted that families are not as close as they used to be.
> 
> Give some reasons why this change has happened and suggest how families could be brought closer together.
> 
> Include any relevant examples from your experience.

The evolution of family dynamics has indeed led to ***a shift away from*** the ***close-knit*** familial bonds of the past. This transformation can ***be attributed to*** several factors, and while it may seem challenging to reunite families as before, there are ways to foster stronger connections.

Primarily, the modern pace of life and ***individualistic values*** have ***eroded*** traditional family closeness. In the past, families lived in ***proximity***, shared daily activities, and relied on each other for emotional support. However, with the rise of ***urbanization*** and ***demanding work schedules***, family members often find themselves ***scattered geographically*** and ***engrossed*** in their own pursuits. For instance, I have observed among my relatives that due to job relocations, family members are living in different cities, making it difficult to gather frequently.

Moreover, technological advancements, ironically designed to bring people closer, have ***inadvertently(unintentionally)*** resulted in ***emotional distancing***. Family members might spend more time interacting with screens than with each other, diminishing ***face-to-face interactions*** and shared experiences. Social media platforms, while keeping individuals informed about each other's lives, ***lack the depth of personal conversations***.

To ***bridge*** this gap and ***nurture familial bonds***, ***deliberate*** efforts are crucial. Regular family gatherings, such as weekend dinners or vacations, provide opportunities for ***genuine*** interaction. ***Setting boundaries on*** screen time during family hours and engaging in activities like games or cooking together can help ***revive*** real relationships. ***Intergenerational storytelling*** and the exchange of life experiences can also enhance ***affective***(emotional/intimate) ***intimacy***.

In conclusion, while societal ***transitions*** and technological changes have led to a ***perceived*** weakening of family ties, ***concerted*** actions can ***certainly*** revitalize these connections. By making conscious choices to spend quality time together and encouraging open communication, families can overcome the challenges of modern life and regain the closeness that was once the ***hallmark*** of family relationships.

### Importance of English as an International Language for Study Abroad

> **Prompt:** 
> 
> Millions of people every year move to English-speaking countries such as Australia, Britain, or America in order to study at school, college, or university.
>
> Why do so many people want to study in English? Why is English such an important international language?
> 
> Give reasons for your answer.

Studying in English-speaking countries has become a widespread aspiration for millions of individuals worldwide. ***There are several reasons driving this phenomenon***, and English's significance as an international language ***plays a pivotal role in*** attracting learners.

***First and foremost***, English ***has emerged as*** the global ***lingua franca*** due to ***historical factors*** such as British ***colonial expansion*** and the dominance of the United States in the post-World War II era. As a result, it has become the primary language of international communication, commerce, and diplomacy. This status as a common language ***fosters*** global connections, ***facilitating*** cross-cultural exchange and understanding.

Moreover, English ***enjoys an unparalleled presence in the fields of*** science, technology, and ***academia***. ***A vast majority of*** scientific research papers, academic publications, and technological advancements ***are conducted and disseminated in English***. Consequently, aspiring scholars and professionals ***view proficiency in English as a gateway to*** accessing ***cutting-edge*** knowledge and collaborating with experts worldwide.

Additionally, English proficiency enhances employability on a global scale. Employers ***in various industries*** prioritize candidates with English language skills, as it allows them to ***engage with a diverse customer base***, expand business opportunities, and work effectively in multinational teams.

Furthermore, studying in English-speaking countries offers students the opportunity to ***immerse themselves in*** an English-speaking environment, which accelerates language learning and promotes cultural understanding. This ***experiential*** approach allows learners to ***gain confidence in*** their language abilities and ***adapt to different cultural norms***.

In conclusion, the appeal of studying in English-speaking countries ***stems from*** English's ***prominent role*** as an international language. ***Its universal application in various sectors***, ***coupled with the advantages of*** cultural exposure and academic excellence, make it an ***indispensable tool*** for those seeking global opportunities and success.

### Lower ticket price



Indeed, reducing airfare allows more passengers to travel by plane. However, in order to ensure their own profits, airlines are bound to attempt to lower operational costs in various aspects. When this involves certain safety-related aspects such as reducing staff training time, skipping pre-flight safety checks, or requiring flights to be extended, it can directly lead to various risks(hazards) and even result in tragic aviation accidents.

### Professional Obligations and Global Mobility

> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

In the ongoing debate over choices of working site in the global environment, there are differing views on whether some well-educated occupations ought to dedicate their expertise to countries where they are cultivated or they should **have complete autonomy in selecting** their workplace. My stance leans towards **a case-by-case consideration of this matter.**

On one hand, I acknowledge that the local society **spends** a substantial amount of resources **on** nurturing experts in specific areas. For example, in countries like China, medical students would receive remarkable subsidies borne by governments during their studying years. This practice aims to develop more doctors and nurses who can contribute to enhancing the **overall well-being of society**. If these students, supported by **public finance**, choose to work abroad after their graduation, it would be **perceived as** unjustified by ordinary citizens who **have  paid taxes** for their education. 

On the other hand, the ability to work and **reside** in a desired place should be legitimate and autonomous for everyone. **With the rapid pace of globalization**, population movement has become a common phenomenon around the world.  Communication and collaboration **between** different countries and regions are **occurring** more frequently and closely, which means the geographic belongings of workforce might not matter as much as they did before. Conversely,  constraining some skilled workers to specific locations could hinder not only their personal career developments but also impede the significant achievements that they could make **for humanity as a whole.** 

In my opinion, striking a balance between personal autonomy and societal duty is acceptable for both sides. For instance, an engineer who is greatly sponsored by public funding could have an obligation to work for **common good** for a specified period, such as 3 to 5 years, and then could work at their preferred places.

In conclusion, while both perspectives on the freedom of choosing workplace have well-founded arguments. I contend that an inclusive and compromised approach would bring about more possibilities and harmony.



### Effectiveness of Ads

> Some people say that advertising is extremely successful at persuading us to buy things. Other people think that advertising is so common that we no longer pay attention to it.
>
> Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
>
> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

In the ongoing debate over effectiveness of current ads, there are differing views on whether it is still a major marketing approach or an outdated promotional strategy due to its overuse. My stance leans towards the former for some compelling reasons.

On one hand, I acknowledge the reality that nowadays **it has become increasingly difficult to** prompt customers to acquire products solely through advertising. No matter how businesses emphasize the novelty of their commodities and services, people have realized the repercussions of excessive consumerism and **have begun to** reassess their genuine purchasing needs. 

On the other hand, **there seems to be** no **alternative** that can replace current advertising approaches yet. Proven practices across diverse fields consistently show that advertisements yield stable and predictable returns in business. Even the most successful corporations **worldwide**, such as Apple and Coca-Cola, cost a fortune in designing, making and distributing advertisements each year. The effectiveness of this investment must have been carefully verified within these major companies, or they **would have no reason to continually bear such substantial expenses.**

In my opinion, the situation forces businesses to improve the quality and delivery of their advertisements. As technology evolves, marketing team is now able to plan more personalized contents for **certain customer groups**, precisely broadcasting promotional information through a wide range of channels. This includes not only traditional media such as TV and radio but also influencers channels. Embracing these changes in advertising can lead to a more efficient and cost-effective marketing investment for most companies.

In conclusion, while both perspectives **on** advertisements **have well-founded arguments**, I contend that an **inclusive** and proactive attitude towards the evolution of the advertising industry would **bring about** more opportunites and innovations.

### Group activities for children (12-3) 

> Some people say that parents should encourage their children to take part in organised group activities in their free time. Others say that it is important for children to learn how to occupy themselves on their own.
>
> Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

The debate surrounding whether parents should actively promote their children's participation in structured group activities during their leisure hours or allow them to develop independent ways of occupying themselves is a topic of great significance. While both perspectives carry merits, my stance is that a balanced approach is essential.

On one hand, proponents of organized group activities argue that they foster teamwork, social skills, and a sense of belonging. Engaging in team sports, arts classes, or scouting groups exposes children to diverse experiences and helps them build strong interpersonal relationships. Moreover, such activities provide a structured environment where they can learn important life skills like time management and cooperation. For instance, participating in a community service project teaches them the value of contributing to society.

On the other hand, allowing children to explore **solitary pursuits** can stimulate creativity, independence, and **self-reliance**. Independent play and personal hobbies enable **youngsters** to discover their passions and develop problem-solving skills. When children engage in imaginative activities alone, they learn to rely on their own **ingenuity**, boosting their confidence and **adaptability**. Such experiences could lead to future success by nurturing their ability to think critically and work **autonomously**.

In my view, a balanced approach is optimal. While structured group activities offer valuable social interactions and skill development, encouraging self-directed activities also cultivates individuality and resourcefulness. Parents should facilitate a diverse range of experiences, ensuring that their children have ample opportunities for both group engagement and solitary exploration. This well-rounded upbringing can lead to well-adjusted individuals who are capable of thriving in various contexts.

In conclusion, the choice between organized group activities and independent pursuits is **not mutually exclusive**. A combination of both approaches equips children with a robust skill set and prepares them for the challenges and opportunities that **lie ahead.**

---

In the ongoiong debate over the optimal management of children's leisure time. My stance leans towards allowing them the freedom to allocate it as they wish. While some argue for involving them in organized group activities, several reasons compel me to prioritize children's autonomy.

On the one side of the spectrum,proponents of group activities argue that children can benefit significantly from cooperation(collaboration/ collaboratting) with others, including personal development and an expanded social circle. Activities such as playing football and participating in a choir require children to work together towards a common objective(goal), thereby develops team work and communication skills,  ***both of which*** are highly valued in professional settings when they grow up(as they mature).

On the other hand, **granting** children the ability to organize their own free time nurtures their time management skills, which are essential throughout life.  If we observe the life **trajectories** of individuals who have achieved great success[u], such as Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, it becomes evident that these individuals excel at setting goals and devising plans to achieve them. They utilize their leisure time more effectively than ordinary people, dedicating it to studying concepts and domains they are interested in, acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary for their plans, and gathering the resources required for their pursuits. All of these **endeavors**(efforts) are founded on their ability(capacity) to **have full control over** their time.

In my view, self-decided time management holds more advantages. It ensures a enconpassing and liberating environment for the majority. We have to confess that not every child accommodates well to teamwork. Furthermore, there are children who develop ambitious goals at a very young age. For these people, imposing compulsory engagement in activities they are not **passionate about** can **stifle(suppress)** individuality and overlook unique talents. Conversely, within such an atmosphere, children who are eager to engage in group activities can still do so.

In conclusion, while both sides have their benefits, I believe that the latter perspective offers a more respectful and empowering environment for the personal and intellectual growth of children.

### Education at home vs. at school
> Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.
>
> Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.
>
> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

In the ongoing discourse(debate/confrontation/controversy) over whether children should be educated at home or ***within the conventional school system***, ***my stance aligns with*** the advantages of embracing modern educational institutions(organizations). While I acknowledge the merits of homeschooling, several compelling reasons lead me to prioritize the more prevalent method of schooling.

On one side of the spectrum, proponents(advocates) of homeschooling argue that the ***one-size-fits-all*** approach of traditional schools can ***stifle*** individuality(personality) and overlook(ignore) unique talents. Schools often follow ***a standardized curriculum*** that may not ***cater to each student's needs*** or passions. For instance, a child with ***exceptional aptitude in physics*** might find their ***potential*** hindered by a ***generic*** education system that ***allocates equal time to all subjects***. However, if guided appropriately at home, the child could immerse themselves in ***their area of interest*** and potentially make ****groundbreaking**** contributions to society.

On the other hand, sending children to school fosters(encourages/promotes/cultivates) ***holistic(comprehensive)*** development. Modern schools are equipped with well-trained teachers who ***possess*** subject expertise and pedagogical(educational) skills. They provide a ***structured*** learning environment, access to various resources like labs and libraries, and opportunities for social interaction. These factors contribute to a comprehensive education that ***goes beyond academics***, nurturing social skills and teamwork.

In my view, formal education within schools holds more advantages. It ensures a ***standardized and consistent*** foundation for ***the majority***. In today's interconnected world, a widespread primary education ***serves to*** enhance human quality and ***mitigate(reduce)*** immediate unemployment. With a balanced and ***requisite*** knowledge, people are prone to develop their critical thinking and avoid being ***manipulated*** by rumors and ***deliberate instigation***, which in the past led to ***hostile*** conflicts, even catastrophic wars and famines.

In conclusion, while both homeschooling and traditional schooling have their benefits, I firmly believe that educating children within a professional educational ***setup*** offers a more structured and inclusive path to personal and intellectual growth. It prepares students not only for their individual success but also for contributing to a harmonious and diverse global community.


### Choosing Friends: Similarity vs. Disagreement
> **Prompt:** 
> 
> Some people think it’s better to choose friends who always have the same opinions as them. Other people believe it's good to have friends who sometimes disagree with them. 
> 
> Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

Friendship is ***a fundamental aspect*** of human interaction, and ***the question of whether to*** associate with those who share similar viewpoints or ***embrace diverse opinions*** has generated ***differing perspectives***. While some ***advocate*** for friends with ***harmonious*** viewpoints, I believe that having friends who occasionally ***challenge our opinions*** can be more beneficial.

***On one hand***, individuals who prefer like-minded friends ***argue that*** such relationships provide comfort and ***validation***. Conversations with these friends are often smoother as ***there are fewer clashes of opinions***, fostering ***a sense of belonging***. Additionally, shared viewpoints can lead to the formation of strong bonds, creating a ***supportive social environment***. This can be particularly important ***during challenging times***, offering a network of individuals who are likely to offer ***unwavering*** support.

On the other hand, ***cultivating*** friendships with differing opinions can be ***intellectually enriching***. Engaging in discussions with such friends can ***broaden one’s perspectives***, ***promote critical thinking***, and encourage personal growth. Experiencing diverse viewpoints challenges individuals to ***reevaluate their own beliefs***, leading to more ***informed and well-rounded*** opinions. Moreover, friendships that encompass differing viewpoints contribute to ***open dialogue*** and tolerance, attributes that are essential for a harmonious society.

In my opinion, having friends with ***assorted standpoints*** is more advantageous. Such friendships stimulate cognitive development, strengthen communication skills, and ***nurturer*** a culture of open-mindedness. Nonetheless, the balance between agreement and disagreement should be maintained. It is important for friends to respect each other's beliefs and ***participate in constructive conversations***.

In conclusion, while both approaches to friendship have merits, I contend that cultivating relationships with friends who offer ***varied thoughts*** can lead to personal and intellectual development. ***Adopting heterogeneous outlooks*** encourages ***analytical thought***, open discourse, and overall self-improvement, adding to a more inclusive and well-rounded society.


### Rise in Extreme Tourism (12-1) 
> **Prompt:** 
> 
> Today more and more tourists are visiting places where conditions are difficult, such as the Sahara desert or the Antarctic.
> 
> What are the benefits and disadvantages for tourists who visit such places?

***In recent times***, an increasing number of tourists ***are drawn to*** destinations characterized by challenging conditions, such as the Sahara desert or the Antarctic. This phenomenon has both advantages and drawbacks, ***which I will discuss in detail below***. (This trend, while ***intriguing***, ***brings forth*** both advantages and drawbacks for the adventurous travelers.)

On the positive side, visiting such demanding ***locales*** offers a unique and ***bold*** experience. Tourists are presented with the opportunity to ***step out of their comfort zones***, fostering personal growth and ***resilience***. These ***unconventional*** trips often lead to lifelong memories and stories to share, ***enhancing one's life perspective***. Additionally, these locations tend to be less crowded than traditional ***tourist spots***, allowing for a more ***intimate*** and ***contemplative*** travel experience.

However, there are also ***notable*** disadvantages to consider. The extreme conditions of these places can pose serious health risks, including ***dehydration***, ***frostbite***, and altitude sickness. Moreover, The ***scarcity of essential infrastructure and basic amenities***, such as reliable roads, medical facilities, and accommodations, in these remote and isolated regions can ***substantially*** amplify the physical demands and present ***formidable*** mental challenges during the journey. This may discourage some individuals, particularly those seeking relaxation and convenience, from undertaking such trips.

In conclusion, the trend of tourists exploring destinations with ***harsh environments*** comes with ***its own set of*** pros and cons. While it offers the ***allure*** of adventure and self-improvement, the potential health ***hazards*** and physical challenges should not be ignored. As long as travelers carefully weigh these ***pluses and minuses*** and make informed decisions, they can **derive unique and enriching experiences from** visiting such demanding destinations.

### Dependence on Computers and the Future

> **Prompt:** 
> 
> We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. 
> 
> What things will they be used in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?
> 
> Give reasons for your answer.

In today's rapidly advancing world, our dependence on computers is undeniable, and their applications continue to ***expand into various domains***. Looking into the future, computers are ***poised*** to ***revolutionize*** several aspects of our lives, from artificial intelligence to space exploration. While their ***integration brings numerous benefits***, we must also approach this ***reliance*** with ***a discerning eye***, balancing the advantages with potential drawbacks.

Firstly, the future will witness a significant advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Computers will ***be utilized to perform complex tasks***, such as medical diagnosis, financial analysis, and autonomous driving. AI-driven technologies have the potential to enhance efficiency and accuracy ***in numerous fields***, contributing to improved decision-making processes and ***problem-solving capabilities***.

Secondly, computers will play a ***pivotal*** role in space exploration. From powering spacecraft to analyzing data from distant planets, computers will be instrumental in ***unraveling*** the mysteries of the universe. The ability to process ***vast amounts of data*** swiftly and accurately will be crucial in ***facilitating groundbreaking discoveries beyond our planet***.

Thirdly, computers will continue to revolutionize communication and connectivity. The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) will enable ***seamless*** integration between everyday objects and computers, further ***streamlining*** our lives. Smart homes, wearable devices, and ***autonomous systems*** are ***just a glimpse of*** the future where computers will play an essential role in enhancing convenience and connectivity.

While the benefits of our growing reliance on computers are undeniable, it is ***prudent*** to ***approach this dependence with caution***. As we ***entrust*** computers with critical tasks, we must ensure ***robust cybersecurity measures*** to ***safeguard against*** potential ***breaches***. Additionally, we should foster digital ***literacy*** to empower individuals to navigate the digital landscape responsibly and critically.

In conclusion, computers will undoubtedly continue to shape our future in numerous domains, ***ranging from*** AI and space exploration to connectivity and communication. ***Embracing these advancements*** offers vast benefits, but we must ***exercise vigilance to mitigate*** potential risks. By striking a balance between embracing technological progress and ***addressing its challenges***, we can ***harness*** the full potential of computers while safeguarding our well-being and ***society's integrity***.

# Small families
> **Prompt:** 
> 
> In many countries today, people in cities either live alone or in small family units, rather than in large, extended family groups. 
> 
> Is this a positive or negative trend?

It is true that cities are seeing a rise in smaller families and one-person households, while the extended family ***is becoming a rarity***. ***In my opinion***, this is a negative development.

As families become smaller, the traditional family support network is disappearing, and this can ***have a negative impact on*** children as they grow up. In a nuclear family or single-parent household, childcare becomes an expensive and stressful part of daily life. Without the help of grandparents or aunts and uncles, busy parents must rely on ***babysitters***, nannies and after-school clubs to take care of younger children, while older children may be left alone after school and during holidays. The absence of adult family members ***can mean that*** friends, television and the Internet become ***the primary influences on children’s behaviour***. ***It is no surprise that*** the ***decline*** of the extended family has been linked to a rise in psychological and behavioural problems amongst young people.

***The trend towards people living alone*** is perhaps even more damaging because of the psychological effects of reduced human interaction. Individuals who live on their own have nobody to talk to in person, so they cannot share problems or discuss ***the highs and lows of daily life***. They **forgo** the constant stimulation and ***hustle and bustle*** of a large family, and are left to their own devices for extended periods of time. The lack of human contact in the home is necessarily replaced by passive distractions, such as television, video games, online chat rooms or Internet surfing. This type of existence is associated with ***boredom***, loneliness, and feelings of isolation or even ***alienation***, all of which are factors that are known to increase the risk of mental illness.

In conclusion, I believe that individuals ***thrive*** when they are part of larger family groups, ***and so it is worrying that*** many people are choosing to live alone or in such small family units.

# Three media
> Compare the advantages and disadvantages of three of the following as media for communicating information. State which you consider to be the most effective.  

• comics  • books  • radio  • television  • film  • theatre 

This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of three different media, namely books, radio and television. I will argue that television is the most powerful of these three media, in terms of its ability to communicate information. The main advantage of books is that they are usually considered to be reliable sources of information. People tend to refer to books when they want to research a subject in depth, and for this reason they continue to play an important role in education. On the other hand, books quickly go out of date, and therefore they are not the best medium for communicating news stories. Radio is a much more effective medium than books for the communication of up-to-date information. We can listen to news broadcasts about events as they happen, and a key benefit of radio is that we can listen to it while doing other activities, such as driving or working. The main drawback of radio, when compared to books or television, is that there is no visual element; we cannot see what the broadcaster is describing. In my opinion, television is the most dynamic of these three media because it brings us closer to reality than a book or radio programme ever can. For example, we can watch events as they take place on the other side of the world, or we can see the body language of a politician who is being interviewed. The disadvantages of television are that programmes tend to be short and interrupted by advertisements, meaning that information is presented in limited depth. In conclusion, while books and radio broadcasts are excellent communication tools, I believe the television can have an even greater impact on the viewer. (286 words, band 9) 

# Artificial intelligence
> Some people believe that nowadays we have too many choices. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

It is often said that modern life presents us with an overwhelming number of choices. I completely agree with this, and I believe that the Internet and globalisation are the two major factors involved.

It is undeniable that the Internet has led to a dramatic expansion in the number of choices that are available to us. The number of online media options, for instance, is now almost endless. There are countless websites offering entertainment, news, videos, on-demand TV and music streaming, many of which are free. I would argue that this abundance of media leads to confusion on the part of the average user, as we have to make so many decisions about the content that we consume. A personal example of this trend would be the fact that I had a choice of just four TV channels when I was a child, whereas I now have access to thousands of films and series through services like Netflix.

Alongside the influence of the Internet, globalisation is making the world smaller and compounding this problem of too much choice. Cheap international flights have made overseas travel possible for millions of people, but this also means that we are faced with a world of options when deciding where to go on holiday or even where to live. We no longer have the limited but simple travel choices of our grandparents’ generation. The same is true if we look at the increasing tendency for young people to study abroad. While the opportunity for overseas study seems appealing, many students are confused about where to go and which path to take.

In conclusion, we are faced with a huge number of options in most areas of life nowadays, and this is often more bewildering than beneficial.

If I were a parent, I would be more than happy to have my children participate in these activities, as it can help them expand their social circles, broaden their horizons, and potentially nurture hobbies that would benefit them for a lifetime.

Compared to home, school is a more complex and closer-to-real-life environment, which helps children develop various skills and abilities needed for social life, such as maintaining interpersonal relationships. When they graduate and ***enter the society***, this knowledge will ***come into play in*** their daily life and workplace.

Compared to the real society, family relationships are relatively simple and warm(cozy), ***but in a way***, they are also singular and limited().

Speaking about the current situation of traditional theaters in China, from my observation, they seem to lack resonance among the younger generation. 

They don't ***have*** much ***interest in*** traditional dramas. (They aren't interested in traditional dramas./ They ***have no interest in*** traditional dramas.)

***Rather than saying that*** young people don't enjoy traditional performances, ***it's more accurate to say that*** many of them don't know how to ***appreciate*** these traditional arts and understand the enjoyment they offer. 

It's noticeable that the government is trying to elevate the status of traditional arts, likely as an effort to preserve cultural heritage. 

However, I believe ***more needs to be done*** in terms of promoting and popularizing these traditional forms of entertainment.

I believe developers can create a senior mode for their applications, offering features like enlarged fonts, placing ***commonly used*** functions on the homepage, and providing a ***dedicated*** customer service channel for seniors.
