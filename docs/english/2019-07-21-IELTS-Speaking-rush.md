# Interaction

Sorry, I don’t quite catch your question. Do you mean …

So am I right saying …

So what you mean is … , right?

Could you please rephrase your question, I don’t quite catch it

I'm afraid that's everything I can think of right now about this topic, is there anything else you wish to know.

Would you like me to talk more about …

Perhaps I should make that clearer by saying …

Maybe it would be more accurate to say …

What I’m suggesting is that

Let me put it another way

In other words, 

To be honest(Actually), I know very little about(I don’t really know much about) birds. However, a friend of mine(One of my friends) often talks to me about sparrows, so I'll assume they are the most common birds in China and continue our conversation.

In fact, I know very little about birds, so I can only base this conversation on some information I've heard.

It seems to me that, 

I’d like to point out that,

Personally, I consider …

As far as I’m concerned, I think …

I’m convinced that

If something goes wrong, I think I would probably …

I would like to … in the future.

I feel inclined to …

I’ll do all I can to …

I'm planning on..." or "I'm thinking about…”

I’m very keen on …

I’ve always liked fishing.

Taking photos is one of my favorite pastimes.

Taking photos is a marvelous way of spending a day off for me.

I can’t find words to express how much I like it.

… plays a significant role in …

We consider `teamwork` to be key to `our success`.

`Environmental conservation` is something we all take seriously.

In most cases, `divorce` is something that both parties realize is necessary.

Generally speaking(In general),

By and large, Chinese students receive a solid foundation in mathematics.

On the whole, most Chinese students receive a solid foundational education.

These days it is quite popular to go on these chat lines

A lot of people think …

I’m afraid what you think about … is not quite right.

If I may say so, it is not the case.

There are some misunderstandings here.

It doesn’t seem correct to say …

I’m not at all sure, actually …

That’s not the way I see it.

Take … for instance …

An example of this would be …

And as evidence of that …

Let me cite a few instances …

To exemplify this theory …

To illustrate my point …

To make it clearer to you …

If all of us were to `eat fast food`, we would `have lot of health problems to deal with`.

If we allow our traditional customs to disappear, this would have a very bad effect on our culture.

The biggest difference between construction about 20 years ago and today is that …

One large way that `big cities` differ from `small cities` is the air.

There are quite a few differences between the way `children and adults make friends.`

There were fewer cars on the roads 20 years ago, compared to now.

I think what should be done is to …

I think this problem could be solved by …

I’m afraid I see it otherwise …

Well, that's an interesting question. `I understand that many people believe` technology has had a `predominantly` positive impact on society, and `I respect their viewpoint`. However, I’m afraid I see it otherwise. `While I acknowledge` the numerous benefits of technology, such as improved communication and access to information, `I also believe it has brought about` some negative consequences, like concerns about privacy and increased screen time. So, I think `it's a complex issue` with both positive and negative aspects.”

It should be discussed `on a case-by-case basis`:

"Well, I believe that when it comes to addressing academic misconduct, it should be discussed on a case-by-case basis. `Each situation can be unique`, and factors like the severity of the misconduct and the `student's intent` `should be taken into account`. So, instead of imposing a standard punishment, `it's important for` academic institutions to carefully consider the specifics of each case to ensure fairness and justice in the disciplinary process.”

This might be true `in some context` but…

Anyway, to get to the point…

The main point I want to make is that…

There is no denying that…

What I actually meant was…

To rephrase what I have just said…

- In the current employment environment, the salary for programmers is somewhat `generous`. I'm someone who prefers(values) a life with less economic pressure(financial stress), so that's the primary reason I chose this profession.

- "My boss is highly professional. He efficiently prioritizes tasks, `delegates assignments` to the most suitable individuals, and `makes decisive decisions`. What I admire most is `his ability to maintain a clear distinction between work and non-work situations`, which makes working with him both relaxed and productive(efficient). `I've learned many valuable qualities` in the workplace from him.”

- "I believe most people generally prefer leadership `in a concise and swift manner` when we are at work

- My colleagues are `predominantly` fellow programmers, and we frequently collaborate on large-scale projects. `They are generally more experienced than I am` and `possess` exceptional technical skills. `I often turn to them for guidance` on technical issues, and they are always friendly and willing to help. `Outside of work`, I `share common interests` such as photography and playing computer games with some of my colleagues. We occasionally get together for dinners and chats, I think this relationship not only fosters a `sense of teamwork` but also makes the workplace enjoyable and comfortable."

- Nobody likes working with `workaholics`

- "I believe my current job is already ideal for me as it offers a good income and a comfortable working environment. `If I were to aim higher`, I'd like to `progress to a more senior position`, which would give me `greater influence` and more resources to pursue my own ideas, rather than solely following orders from leaders.”

- "`If I had the opportunity to` choose a different profession, I would consider becoming a baker and opening(running) my own bakery. I `have a deep passion for the aroma of freshly baked bread`, and `working in such an environment`(in that kind of) would be `stress-free` and bring me a sense of happiness. Moreover, I believe that providing people with healthy and `wholesome` food is a highly meaningful endeavor.”

- People work for various reasons: to earn a living, achieve career goals, or seek a sense of `self-worth`. Personally, I believe those who work for the last reason tend to be the happiest.

- "The ecosystem suffered `unrecoverable` harm when the species went extinct."


# Task-1

### Work - M

- ***What work do you do?***

    "I'm a Software Development Engineer, `or more commonly`, I'm a programmer. I work for a local major game company. My primary responsibilities include writing code for the physics engine used to develop games."

- ***Why did you choose to do that type of job?***

    "`Mostly out of interest I think`, I quite enjoy playing video games, and I hope to be able to create some `prestigious` games like Super Mario or The Legend of Zelda. So, it is very natural for me to consider joining a game company."

- ***Do you like your job?***
   "I'm quite satisfied with my current job. `Most of the time`, working with code is enjoyable because programmers can see the `tangible results` of their work. I really `appreciate the immediate feedback` and sense of accomplishment it offers. Additionally, the `compensation` `for this job` `meets my expectations`, as I `prefer not to` have significant financial pressure in my life. So, overall, `I'm quite content`.”

- ***Do you miss being a student?***

    "Not really. I `attended` a very strict and `demanding` high school and university, and `it took me a lot of effort to graduate`. While I did appreciate what that period `brought` to me, I truly don't want to `go through` that kind of life again."

- ***Is it very interesting?***

    "`I'm not sure if` 'interesting' `is the right word for` that period. It was a time when I had a very clear objective and kept dedicated all the time. In fact, it's a disciplined and `passionate` lifestyle, but it was `rewarding` but also quite `exhausting`. I often `felt burnt out` after `a full day of` studying." (study)

    Yes, working in a game company is quite pleasant for me, firstly the atmosphere is more relaxed compared to some traditional companies, and I can find many colleagues who `share the same interest with me`, making `the time at the workplace` `enjoyable`. Moreover, working with code is fulfilling for me because programmers can see the `tangible results` of their work. I really `appreciate the immediate feedback` and sense of accomplishment `when my code runs as expected.`
    
- ***Is there any kind of technology you use at work?***

    "Yes, since programming is closely connected to computers and `automation`, we `utilize any available technological advancements` to `aid our work`, Such as `the newly popular` generative AI models, we have `integrated` them into our toolchain to `assist` us `in` correcting our code and providing constructive advice to guide our work."

- ***Can you manage your time well when you work?***

    "`I wouldn't say I'm exceptionally proficient at it,` but I do have some strategies to make my work more efficient and `organized`. I have a habit of making work plans on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Additionally, I learned a method for `maintaining focus` during work or study when I was in college. It's called the `Pomodoro` Technique, which involves dividing your work into 25-minute `intervals` and `dedicating yourself strictly to each timer`. `It has proven to be quite useful` for me."

- ***Who helps you most at work?***

    I think it should be my boss, while I was `assigned` a mentor `when I first joined`, but he is a very busy, anxious person and `has no interest teaching rookies`, so `I got very limited guidance` from him. But fortunately, I received some valuable advice from my boss about `work methods` and `attitude`. He was the one who taught me the importance of professionalism `in the early stages of my career`, and I greatly appreciate `the long-lasting impact` of his advice."
    
    "I've had some limited formal training, mainly focused on our `work processes`. As a programmer, much of my job involves `self-learning` and `seeking guidance` from experienced colleagues `when it comes to` the `specific tasks` and skills required.”

- ***Why did you choose to do that type of job?***

    "`When I was in high school`, I `had a strong interest in` physics. So, `when it came time for` my undergraduate studies, I `chose to major in` nuclear physics. `During my time at university,` I `stumbled across`/on the IT industry through some `chance encounters`, and I `developed a desire to` work in this field. That's why, `after graduating`, I pursued a master's degree in computer science.”

### Hometown  (M)

- ***Where are you from?***

    "I'm from a city called Mianyang in the Sichuan province of China, which is located in the mountainous region `in the western part of` the country. You `might have heard of` another more famous city called Chengdu; we're `approximately` 100 kilometers `away from` there. Also, you may be familiar with pandas; And our region is a major `habitat` for these incredible animals.”
    
- ***Tell me about your hometown.***

    "My hometown `is situated in` a mountainous region with `a relatively high altitude`. The climate there is quite mild, with sunny and cool weather `for most of the year`, making it a very pleasant place to live.  `It used to be primarily focused on` military-related industries, but `over the years`, they `have shifted towards` `civilian enterprises`. Nowadays, it's known for producing components for televisions, electric vehicles, and `various other electronic devices`. The majority of population of the city are mainly ~~`comprised of`~~ skilled `technicians` and `researchers`(The population of the city mainly `consists of` skilled technicians and researchers.), many of them were `relocated` from different parts of the country `during the planned economy era in the previous century`. `Similar to` most areas in Sichuan, people in my hometown `are accustomed to(are used to)` a relaxed(laid-back) `pace of life` and prioritize their quality of life over the `relentless work ethic` often seen in coastal regions like Guangzhou, where I'm currently living. People work so hard here and tend to `overlook` their families and the need to rest. I actually don't think this is a healthy or sustainable way of living. Perhaps people in my hometown know better how to enjoy their lives(`Back in` my hometown, people seem to have a better `grasp` of how to enjoy life.”).”
    
- ***What's your favorite thing  in your hometown***

    "My favorite thing in my hometown is the diverse and flavorful cuisine. It's predominantly Sichuan-style, known for `its widely use of spices(chili pepper) in seasoning dishes` to `enhance the flavors of the dishes.` Additionally, due to the historical immigration `patterns`, people from various regions have brought their own `culinary` styles and insights, making the food here inclusive and comprehensive.”
    
- ***What's your favorite place in your hometown***

    "There is a well-maintained `Riverside avenue` I often visit. It is a perfect place for running and biking as the abundance of plants there provide a fresh air. And it is featured with a variety of public amenities like fitness equipment, sports fields, and open `squares` along with it. It's a `hub` of activity, especially `during the early mornings and evenings` when locals gather here for exercise and leisure activities.
    
    Additionally, `there's a diverse range of` restaurants and tea houses `along the street`. This makes it a perfect spot for `socializing with friends`, `whether it's for` a casual chat or a meal. `I find it` incredibly refreshing `to` spend time there, `taking in the beautiful scenery` and enjoying the `vibrant` atmosphere."
    
- ***Tell me about some scenic spots in your hometown***

    "In my hometown, there's a beautiful place called the Wolong Nature Reserve. It's actually a national park mainly covered in forests, and it `boasts` stunning natural landscapes. It's a perfect destination for those who `love to immerse themselves in nature`. What makes it even more special is that it's the primary habitat for pandas. In fact, it houses the world's largest breeding and research center for these incredible creatures.Every year, visitors from all around the globe come here to `witness` and learn about these lovable animals.”

- ***Has your hometown changed much these years?***

    "Yes, my hometown has changed quite a bit in recent years. I'm not sure if you're aware, but in 2008, Sichuan experienced a major(severe) earthquake. Since then, many buildings and places have been rebuilt, including my old high school. `I went back to` visit a couple of years ago, and the new campus and teaching buildings have become very modern and beautiful.”

- ***Is that a big city or a small place?***

    "It's a big city. I'm currently in Guangzhou, which is one of the largest cities in China, `along with` Beijing and Shanghai. It has a population of over 20 million people and has been a major `metropolitan` area in southern China for centuries.”

- ***How long have you been living here?***

    "I've been living here for nearly two years. I originally moved here for a job opportunity, and I `anticipate` that I'll be here for another year.”

- ***How has your area changed in recent years?***

    In the past, `there was a period where`, due to the boom in the `real estate market(due to the thriving real estate market)`, the entire nation was `vigorously` constructing residential buildings and the `accompanying` infrastructure, with construction sites everywhere, `symbolizing` rapid `urbanization`. However, this trend has significantly slowed down now.
    
    `In the past decade`, `I've had the opportunity to` live in several different cities, but `my stays in each of them` were relatively short, so I didn't personally `witness` significant changes in those areas. However, I do k`eep up with` the news and trends in each place I've lived, and I've `noticed a few general trends` of change in urban areas in recent years.
    
- ***Is there anything you dislike about it?***

    "Yes, there are a few things `I dislike about` it. Firstly, `it can get` quite crowded here, and the traffic is always congested. Going out for a meal or shopping often involves `waiting in long lines`. I'm not particularly `fond of` crowded places, but I understand that some people enjoy the hustle and bustle, which they refer to as 'vibrancy' or 'a lively atmosphere.' It gives them a sense of being alive.”

- ***For you, what benefits are there living in a big city?***

    "For me, there are `primarily` two benefits to living in a big city. First, it `offers better infrastructure and services`. For instance, `if I were to take the IELTS exam`, there are multiple test centers in Guangzhou, `whereas` my hometown, a smaller city, doesn't have any. Second, it's influenced by employment opportunities. Larger cities tend to have more high-quality companies, which `in turn` provide more and better `job prospects`. Overall, residing in a metropolitan area is more advantageous for personal development.”

- ***Where in your country do you live?***

    "I currently reside in Guangzhou, which is a coastal city `located along the river`. It's `at the heart of` the urban area in southern China and is conveniently close to two other major cities, Shenzhen and Hong Kong, both of which are within a 200-kilometer radius.”
    
- ***what are the main places of interest in your hometown***

    "In my hometown, there are several main places of interest. One of the most renowned attractions is the Wolong National Nature Reserve, famous worldwide for its role as a habitat and research center for giant pandas. Additionally, my hometown holds significant historical importance as it was a vital territory during the famouse Three Kingdoms period `in` Chinese history. As a result, it boasts a plethora of historical sites and ancient architectural treasures from that era. These historical relics continue to attract `a substantial number of` history enthusiasts and tourists from around the globe.”
    
- ***Do you like your hometown, Why or why not***

    Yes, I do like my hometown. the climate in my hometown is quite `livable`. We have mild winters and `pleasant` summers, which make it comfortable to live there `throughout` the year.
    
    The town has a laid-back atmosphere, the pace of life is not as `hectic` as in larger cities, which I find very relaxing and enjoyable.
    
    The local cuisine is simply fantastic. We have a variety of delicious dishes that `are unique to the region`, and `I take great pride in` our food culture.
    
    However, there are some `downsides`. One of the challenges is that there are relatively few good job opportunities in my hometown, especially `in my field of interest`. This has made me consider exploring different places and experiencing various aspects of life while I'm still young.
    
- ***What is the difference between your hometown and Beijing***

    Well, there are several `notable` differences between my hometown and Beijing.
    
    Firstly, the climate `is a significant contrast`. My hometown has a much milder and more livable climate compared to Beijing, which can get extremely cold and dry in the winter. This weather factor `plays a role in my preference for` staying in my hometown.
    
    And when it comes to career and employment. Beijing does offer a wider range of job opportunities, particularly in the tech industry where I work as a programmer. It's known for its thriving `tech scene`, and I could potentially find excellent job prospects there.
    
    However, the `cost of living`, especially housing, is considerably higher in Beijing. The `property market` in Beijing is quite expensive, and it would be challenging for young people to afford a comfortable living situation in the city.
    
- ***What are the people like in your hometown***

    "In my hometown, the people have a laid-back lifestyle, which means they enjoy `taking things easy` and `savoring` life's simple pleasures. Many of them `are fond of` traditional activities like playing mahjong and `poker`, both of which are popular pastimes that brings communities together.
    
    Moreover, people in my hometown `take great pride(are proud of)` in their local cuisine and culture. Our food is known for its unique flavors and `recipes` that `have been passed down through generations.`
    
- ***If you could change one thing about your hometown, what would it be?***

    "If I could change one thing about my hometown, I would focus on `creating more job prospects`. Currently, many young people, including myself, feel `compelled` to leave our hometowns and migrate to larger cities `in search of` better job opportunities. We all have dreams of working in our fields of interest and expertise, and it would be wonderful if our hometowns could provide those positions.
    
- ***What attractive pieces of architecture are there in your hometown***

    The most `iconic` `landmarks` in Chongqing is the Hongya Cave, a multi-story traditional building complex that beautifully combines modern and ancient architecture. `It's perched on the edge` of the Jialing River, and its `intricate` design and colorful lights make it a popular `tourist attraction`, especially at night.
    
- ***Is your hometown a good place for young people to live?***

    "Not really, my hometown doesn't offer many opportunities for young people. There are limited `job prospects`, and most young individuals tend to seek better positions in coastal areas or larger cities, where there is more economic development and a wider range of choices available.”
    
- ***Do you think the area you live in now is suitable for people of all ages?***

    "No, I don't believe the area I currently reside in is suitable for people of all ages. The climate here is quite `humid` and hot, which can be uncomfortable, especially for older individuals(`the elderly`). Additionally, `there are issues with heavy pollution`, and it tends to be crowded, which can be challenging for both the elderly and young children. Many young adults come here primarily for job opportunities and career prospects, leading to a `somewhat` imbalanced demographic.”
    
- ***Do you know any famous people in your area?***

    Yes, in my area, there's a historical figure known as Sun Yat-sen. He played a crucial role in ending the last dynasty in China and is widely respected as the Father of the Republic. In fact, we have a `prestigious` university named after him, which `reflects` his significant influence on our region's history and education.”
    
- ***Where do you like to go in your area?***

    "`I don't have a fixed pattern for where` I like to go in my area, but I often find myself visiting various restaurants. There's a wide range of `dining options` here, from `cozy` cafes to international cuisines, and I enjoy exploring different flavors and `trying new dishes`. `Besides that`, I also like to visit local parks for a leisurely walk, especially on sunny days. `It's a great way to` unwind and enjoy the natural beauty of the area. Additionally, there are a few `cultural spots` like museums and theaters that I occasionally visit to catch a show or learn something new.”
    

### Home  (M) once

- ***Are the transport facilities in your city very good?***

    Yes, they are quite good `in some ways`. We have a `well-developed` public transportation system, including buses, subways, and ferries. most of them are equipped with many user-friendly amenities and signs. These transport options make it convenient to `get around the city`, especially for `daily commuting`. However, the `downside` is that our city `has a very high population density`, which often leads to `overcrowding` during `rush hours`. So, while the transport options themselves are good, `having too many people use them` can make it feel a bit stressful `at times`.”
    
-Which room does your family spend most of the time in?

    "We gather in `the combined dining and living room` for `a significant portion of our home time`. This is where we have our meals, watch television, and have conversations."
    
- ***Do you currently live in a house or a flat?***
    "I currently live in a rented flat, which is located in a newly built `apartment complex`. The flat itself is quite `spacious`, covering an area of about 70 `square meters`. I choose there as residence for its convenient public transport and quiet environment.

- ***Can you describe your residence***

    "Sure, I currently live in a rented flat, which is located in a newly built apartment complex `in a quiet neighborhood`. The flat itself is `well-maintained` and is `equipped` with high-quality `appliances` and furniture. It provides enough space `for two people to live`, there are two bedrooms, and a separate small room that I use as `a home office and study space`. The living room is `cozy` and has a nice view of the surrounding area. Overall, `I'm quite satisfied with` my residence as it meets my needs(expectations) `for both comfort and functionality.`”

- ***How long have you lived there?***

    "I've been living there for nearly two years now. I `moved to this city` for a job change `in January of last year.`”
    
- ***Do you plan to live here for a long time?***

    "Well, `I have no plan to live here permanently`. I `guess I would stay here for at most another year.`  The weather here is quite humid and hot, which I find uncomfortable at times, and `considering my job prospects`, I will probably go to Shanghai `in the foreseeable future`
    
- ***Do you live alone or with your family?***

    "I live with my wife and our adorable cat. Our parents live in different cities, and they visit us `from time to time` and `stay for short periods`.”
    
- ***What do you usually do in your house/flat/room?***

    "When `I get back home` after work, I often take a shower and then watch TV series in the living room with my wife. On weekends, I usually stay in the home office, which is a quiet and `dedicated` space `where I can focus`. I play computer games or learn some `career-related knowledge` since technology `evolves` quickly in our industry. We don't cook very frequently, most of the time we eat at workplace, so we only store some snacks, `instant foods` and drinks at home.
    
- ***Which is your favorite room in your home?***

    It should be the home office I think. It's not very big, but it's `wonderfully` quiet and cozy. `I find it to be the perfect place for concentration and focus`, especially when I'm `working on` my projects or studying.
    
- ***What main items of furniture or appliances do you have in each room***

    "`(Let me think for a moment)`, In our home, each room has its specific furniture and appliances. In the bedrooms, we have beds and `wardrobes`, a king-size bed for us and a single one for guests. And in the home office, there is a table, comfortable chairs, a large monitor, and two computers. In the combined living and dining room, we have a TV and a `dining table`. Finally, in the bathroom, we only have a shower, no `bathtub`.”
    
- ***Is it a typical house in your city***

    "No, it's not very typical. Most houses here are newly built apartments with a more western and modern style, and most of them are `one-story` flat. But typical houses are generally more `spacious`, often with `multiple stories`, and have a more traditional decoration, often featuring expensive wooden furniture.”
    
- ***What's the difference between where you are living now and where you lived in the past?***

    "`In terms of` the housing itself, `there isn't a significant difference`. `Since I started working`, `I have always rented flats from the same agency`, which is a `nationwide chain`, which means that the layout and decoration of flats they provide are fairly `consistent` `across different cities`.”
    
- ***What can you see `when you look out the window` of your room?***

    I can see a small river flowing by and two other apartment buildings, as well as some lush greenery, I can't see the main road from my location because `there is still a(some) distance` and it is `obstructed` by the apartment buildings as I mentioned earlier. In fact, most of the time, you have to keep curtains closed(drawn) during the day in Guangzhou since the `sunlight` is quite `intense`.
    
- ***Would you be willing to live in the countryside in the future?***

    "`I'm not certain(sure) (about it) at this moment.` `It may be possible` in the future, if I can achieve `financial independence` and no longer need to `commute to work`. However, `in the foreseeable future`, I `would prefer to` live closer to my workplace to gain myself more time to rest, you know, `by minimizing the the daily commute.`
    
- ***What kind of house do you want to live in in the future.***

    "Actually, `I'm open to` various housing options, such as an flat or `a detached house`. `Size isn't my primary concern`, as long as it offers enough space and functionality. `What matters most to me` is having a `reasonable layout` and well-decorated `interiors` for comfortable living. 
    
- ***Do you like the decor in your home? Why or why not***

    I'm content with the current `decor` in my home. It's simple, modern, and user-friendly, it `aligns with(matches)` my `practical nature`. `I prefer functionality over excessive and complex decoration.` The `minimalist` design not only `makes the space look` clean and `organized` but also creates a relaxing and dedicated atmosphere.
    
- ***Will you move to another residence `in the near future`.***

    Yes, `I do have plans to` move to Shanghai for career prospects. So a relocation is `inevitable` `in the near future`. I've been researching potential housing options for some time to `ensure a smooth transition`.”
    
- ***What kind of residence are you going to move into.***

    I think I will continue renting a flat from my current agency, they are a nationwide chain and offer `consistent` and `reliable` `housing services`, which `have been proven to be suitable for me`.. The only thing I need to consider is finding one that's `close to my future workplace."`
    
- ***What are your neighbors like?***

    "In fact, I don't `have much interaction with` my neighbors because I'm a tenant, and in large cities, `it's quite common for` neighbors to `have limited contact` with each other. `Everyone seems to have busy lives,` and it's not easy to `come across` them frequently. But at least I didn't `encounter` any `disturbances` from them, like noise or anything else, so I assume they are nice people.
    
- ***Are people in your area friendly?***

    "Well, to be honest, I don't have `extensive` interactions with them. But, I have witnessed `some acts of kindness` that may suggest they are friendly. I recall that there was an `incident` where someone found a lost cat and `posted about it` in the `elevator` to help find the owner, it seems the little cat got excellent care, I thought it was a really `considerate` `gesture`, and left me an impression that my neighbors `seem to be` friendly and helpful.
    

### Weather and climate  (M) once
- ***What type of weather do you like?***

    "I prefer sunny and cool weather, it is suitable for `drying clothes and bedding` and outdoor activities. In contrast, a `humid and hot weather tends to` make me `sweat a lot`, and I don’t like that feeling. 
    
- ***What type of weather do Chinese people usually like?***

    "Chinese people generally prefer mild and dry weather. `Excessively` humid climates can make clothes and bedding difficult to dry and `are associated with concerns about hygiene` and diseases in our traditional culture.”
    
- ***Which is your favorite season?***

    "I would say `autumn`. Because the weather is `pleasantly` cool, making it great for outdoor activities and won't make you sweat a lot. And I especially enjoy the sight of `falling leaves.`”
    
- ***Which is your least favorite season?***

    My least favorite season `would have to be winter.` In the area where I live, the temperature often drops close to `freezing` during winter, and we don't have `centralized` heating. So, even `indoors` can get quite `chilly`, and significantly restrict(constrain) daily activities and work
    
- ***Do you do different things in summer and in winter?***

    "Yes, I like to `make the most of` the unique opportunities each season offers. During the summer months, there are various way to `take advantage of` the warm weather, such as going to the beach to enjoy the sunlight and swim in the ocean. It's a great time for outdoor barbecues and picnics as well. On the other hand, in winter, I tend to do some cold-weather only activities like `skiing` and `relaxing in hot springs`. 
    
- ***What do you often do on sunny day***

    "On a sunny day, I often enjoy outdoor activities like running or `playing sports`, as long as it's not too hot. Also, it's a great opportunity to do some `household chores` like laundry and `sun-drying` `clothes and bedding`.”
    
- ***What do you often do on rainy days***

    "On rainy days, I'll try to stay indoors as much as possible because `I don't like the feeling of getting wet`. I like to spend my time playing video games, reading books, or watching movies. It's a great opportunity to `catch up on my favorite novels` or explore new video games.
    
- ***What is the `rain distribution` in China?***

    I guess `it follows a pattern similar to` many other countries, rainfall in China is higher in `coastal areas` compared to `inland regions`. And the southern parts of China receive more rainfall than the northern regions.”
    
- ***How does rain affect people’s lives?***

    "Well, it can affect our `daily routine` by requiring us to carry umbrellas, forcing us to change our plans as it `impacts` our outdoor activities and mood. And it can significantly affect `dietary choices and clothing habits` `in a region` as the `agriculture heavily relies on rainfall`. Moreover, sometimes long time heavy rain can cause `flooding` and severely threaten infrastructure and people's well-being
    
    Those `involved in` agriculture `are the most affected group by rainfall` because it plays a crucial role in `crop selection` and `year-round yields`. 
    
- ***What is the weather like in your city?***

    "Guangzhou is a southern `coastal` city with a `typically` hot and humid climate, and with an `abundant` rainfall `throughout the year`. I have to say this sort of weather can be uncomfortable for me `at times`.”
    
### Fishing  (M) once
- ***Is fishing popular in your country?***

    "Yes, fishing is extremely popular in China. In fact, I can find people fishing along almost every `riverbank` in every city `I've been to`. `Even in heavy rain,` you can still see people out there enjoying their time by the water, with their umbrellas. I believe they truly find it enjoyable.”
    
- ***Have you ever been to a place where there are lots of fish around you?***

    "Yes, I have. One time, I visited a bustling seafood market near the waterfront, I live in a `coastal` city ~~that `is situated at the mouth of a major river`~~, with a thriving fishing industry, so the market `was filled with` a wide variety of fish, `some of which I couldn't even name.`
    
- ***Have you seen any movies featuring lots of fish?***

    "Yes, I've watched a movie called 'Finding Nemo', if I remember correctly. It is an adorable `animated film` and tells a story of a clownfish father's journey to find his captured son, Nemo. `Most of the characters` in this movie are `fish`.”
    
- ***Why do some people like fishing?***

    Well, I don't `go fishing` myself, so I can't `speak from direct experience`. But `I guess it can because` it offers a sense of relaxation and `accomplishment` as people spend time `in a peaceful natural setting`, away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. And sometimes they can get some very tangible outcomes from this activity. 

- ***Do you like eating fish?***

    "~~`I don't have a strong liking for` eating fish.~~ Not really, in fact, I dislike the `fishy taste` and I find it `bothersome` to deal with `fish bones`. Although I `acknowledge` that fish is a good source of `protein`, `I have a preference for` beef or pork.”
    
- ***Where can you see fish?***

    "As I mentioned earlier, you can find `a wide variety of live fish` in Chinese markets. Furthermore, there is a large `aquarium` in Guangzhou where people can observe `a diverse range of` `marine fish`.”
    

### Geography  (M) once
- ***Do you want to be a geography teacher?***

    "I think I'm willing to become a geography teacher because I `have a strong interest in` this subject. I can recall that when I was in primary school, I could `spend entire afternoons` studying world maps, and I believe `I would be qualified for` this job as I was quite good at geography during my school years.”
    
- ***Do you think geography is useful?***

    "Yes, I think everyone should `have a fundamental understanding of` geography because it helps people `navigate` and `explore the world more effectively`. For instance, `being able to read maps` helps us `find our way` `in unfamiliar places` and `make trip plans`. Additionally, `knowing climate patterns` and `geographic information` can be valuable for `personal safety` and `making informed decisions` when going out.”
    
- ***Have you ever studied geography at school?***

    "Yes, I have. In China, geography is a `compulsory(mandatory)` subject in the `foundational curriculum`. And if students `continue to high school`, they will study advanced geography `for an additional` three years.”
    
- ***Do you like geography?***

    "I have a strong interest in geography, particularly `in the social aspects` of the subject. I enjoy `learning about`  `geographical information` of countries `I've heard of`, because I find understanding `these connected information` often provides a more comprehensive `insight` `into` some historical events, and this learning process is very `intriguing` to me.”
    

### Cinema  (M) once 
- ***Did you usually go to the cinema when you were a child?***

    "I would say yes, my parents are fond of watching movies, so they often `took me along` when they went to cinema, as long as the film `was suitable for children`.”
    
- ***Do you often go to the cinema with your friends?***

    "Not really, `most of the time` I went to cinema alone or with my wife, I can't even remember the last time I went to cinema with friends.
    
- ***Do you still like the same kind of movie which you liked when you were a child?***

    "Not really, `I can't say I had a specific preference` when I was a kid; I watched almost every film I could find. But now, I tend to watch more drama and documentaries.”
    
- ***What genres of films do you like?***

    "I think it would be `drama and documentary` films. I find a `well-crafted` script can `immerse` the audience completely `into` the story. Compared to action or thriller genres, these types can `evoke more emotions` and deep(`profound`) thinking, and that’s why I’m inclined to watch them `over and over again.”`
    
- ***Do you think going to the cinema is a good way to spend time with friends?***

    "I'm not sure, in fact, `I would agree more with the idea` that friends should `engage in` more conversation when they hang out. And from this perspective, watching movies together doesn’t `seem like` a good option, since they need to stay quiet when `the movie is playing.”`
    

### Coffee or tea  (M) once
- ***Do you like to drink coffee or tea?***

    "I prefer coffee because `I developed a habit` of drinking it in the morning since high school. It helps `wake me up` and keeps me warm in the winter. Additionally, `a coffee with sugar and milk` can provide more energy than other drinks for breakfast, making it ideal for `a full day of studying`."
    
- ***How often do you drink coffee or tea?***

    "During the weekdays, I drink coffee almost every two hours, sometimes even more if I feel tired and `unfocused`. Not only for taking in some `caffeine` but also as an excuse to take a break. I drink less on non-working days because there is no need to `stay awake all the time`.”
    
- ***Do Chinese people like to drink coffee or tea?***

    It mostly depends on the age I think, you'll often find that `older people` tend to prefer tea, as it's a `deeply traditional` beverage in China, and coffee is notably popular among the younger generation, especially in urban areas, because young `workforce` there heavily relies on it to stay awake `during work`.”
    
- ***Do you prefer to use tea or coffee to serve your guests?***

    "`I think it would be better to` let them decide, so I always keep both tea and coffee in my home."

    It depends on which one they `are used to`(are accustomed to), I keep both tea and coffee `available` in my home. While I personally drink coffee `more often`, it is common in China to serve tea after a meal.”
    
- ***When was the last time you drank coffee or tea?***

    "This morning, before `coming here to take the test`, I had a cup of coffee and a slice of `toast`."
    

### Musical instrument  (M)

- ***Do you know how to play a musical instrument?***
    
    No, I can't play any instruments. I did learn the violin `for a short time`, but I `didn't stick with` it, and I've almost `forgotten everything about it`.

- ***Do you think students should learn to play musical instruments at school?***
    
    Yes, I completely agree with this `proposal`. Firstly, I believe it offers `a practical approach to music and aesthetic education`. Developing a good taste in music can bring children `a great deal of joy` in their future lives. Furthermore, practicing musical instruments can also enhance children's ability to `coordinate their bodies`.

- ***Have you taken any classes on musical instruments in school?***
    
    Yes, I have. In fact, a music course is `mandatory` in the Chinese foundational education curriculum. To help students better understand music, we are often taught how to play the Chinese flute, which is made by wood but metal.

- ***Which musical instrument do you like?***

    When it comes to the `listening experience` and acting style, I prefer the `trumpet`. As you know, it's a crucial instrument in `blues music`, a genre I quite enjoy

- ***How easy would it be to learn to play a musical instrument without a teacher?***

    Personally, I find it quite challenging because `I have experience learning the violin`, and I fully acknowledge that a teacher can `promptly` and accurately correct your `mistakes`. This correction is crucial in the learning process, as beginners often struggle to identify these errors and can easily develop bad habits without proper guidance.

### Robots  (M)

- ***How do robots affect our lives?***
    
    "With the rapid development in robotics, there are now several types of robots that can `perform household chores` such as cleaning floors and `controlling electric devices` based on homeowner's `commands`. `In an industrial context`, robots are increasingly `replacing` humans in some dangerous roles, such as miners or operators `working at heights.”`
    
- ***Are you interested in robots?***
    
    "Yes, but compared to being interested in the technique itself, I `care more about` what it can bring to our human society, such as whether its progress can help liberate our productivity and replace all `repetitive` and dangerous jobs with robots, allowing humans to `pursue their true passions` without having to `worry too much about` income or other `concerns`.”
    
- ***Did you like any films about robots when you were a child?***
    
    Not really. I guess I used to prefer movies about animals or magic, like Harry Potter series. But when I grow up, I gradually realize that, in fact robots technology,  to some extent, `are playing a similar role to` magic, by `saving us effort` but `accomplishing the same tasks`.
    
- ***Do you use robots in daily life?***
    
    "Yes, I work at a technology company, and in our workspace, we have robots that are trained to `perform tasks` such as delivery and cleaning. I often receive packages that `I've ordered online` from a delivery robot.”
    
- ***Will you feel comfortable if you are in a car driven by a robot?***
    
    "In fact, I `have taken the car you're describing` several times, and I find the experience to be quite `acceptable`, perhaps because `they operate in a specific zone`, and thus the `traffic conditions` are simpler. I notice a notable advantage of these robot drivers: they are more stable and consistent, `unlike` a human driver who can `vary a lot from person to person.”`
    

### Noise  (M)

- ***Do you like to stay in a noisy place?***

    "Absolutely no, I dislike noisy and crowded environments; they can make me `feel stressed` and anxious. I prefer `staying in` a quiet and dedicated place to `do my own stuff`."

- ***Are there any quiet places in your city?***

    Yes, `apart from my own residence`, I find some libraries and cafes to be very `tranquil`, where you can find many people `focused on their work and studies`. I quite like that atmosphere.

- ***Do people have the right to make noise?***

    `It really depends on the circumstances`, I think. For example, if you are `participating in` celebrations, `rock concerts` or something like that, of course, you have the right to be loud. But in most public places, `it's good manners to` keep quiet and not `disturb others`

- ***Do you like loud music?***

    I would say yes, I also `include` some rock music `in my playlist` when I'm working out, like when I'm running or `doing equipment exercises`. They are loud and fast-paced, and I find that this music `motivates` and `energizes` me.

- ***Is it noisy around the area where you live***
    
    No, it's quite `tranquil` where I live. It's a purely residential area `with no factories nearby`, and `it's far from the main street`, so `you are hardly disturbed by` the noise of vehicles. In fact, that is one of the primary reasons I chose to live here.
    
- ***What do you think can be done to control noise***
    
    "Well, I think individuals can choose to live in quieter neighborhoods or residences `away from` noise sources like `construction sites or busy roads`. Secondly, it's important to `implement(introduce) regulations` that limit `noisy activities` during `certain hours`, especially in residential and educational areas. For example, construction sites could `be restricted from operating` during late hours to reduce `disturbance`. Additionally, planting more trees and greenery is known to help `absorb and reduce noise pollution.` So, `these are a few steps` that can be taken to `tackle the issue of noise pollution effectively."`
    
- ***How does noise affect people’s life and work***
    
    It can be highly `distracting` when people are trying to concentrate on their tasks, making it difficult to `maintain focus and productivity.` Moreover, `prolonged exposure to loud noises` can have `detrimental effects` `on both physical and mental health,` potentially leading to stress, `sleep disturbances`, and other health issues
    

### Running (M)

- ***Do you like running?***
    
    Yes, I really enjoy running. `I've been into running for a little over two years now`, it has become `a part of my daily routine`. I try to run regularly, typically `covering a distance of 3 to 5 kilometers` every day. It allows me to `stay fit` and maintain a healthy lifestyle
    
- ***Where do you run?***
    
    "I run `along a riverside path` near my residence. `There aren't many people`, which is great for running. And `it's far from the road,`surrounded by `lush` greenery, so I can `breathe in` fresh, `unpolluted` air. However, it can get `slippery` when it rains, so I avoid running there `on rainy days`.”
    
- ***Which places do you think are perfect for running?***
    
    "`I would say that` professional indoor running `tracks` are perfect places because they `are not affected by weather conditions`, and the `rubberized` surface provides a comfortable and `slip-resistant` running experience. However, `it's worth noting that` such facilities `may not be very common`, and they often `come with` relatively high `fees`.”
    
- ***Do you think running is a good way to stay healthy?***
    
    "`Speaking from my personal experience(personally speaking)`, I've found that regular running `has been quite effective in helping` me maintain a healthy weight; `I've actually lost quite a few pounds`(quite a bit of weight) and now `stay within a healthy range`. Additionally, my `endurance` has greatly improved, and my overall mental well-being `has seen` a significant `boost` as well.”

- ***Are there any shops selling ice cream near the place where you live?***
- ***Can you make ice cream by yourself?***

"Maybe it sounds strange, but I find myself eating ice cream `more frequently` `in the winter`. This is because, when I was a child, not every vendor in our town had a `fridge`, so they would usually store ice cream in a large container as `insulation` to prevent it from melting quickly due to the summer heat. However, when winter `arrived`, they had no such `concerns`, they could sell ice cream `all day long`. That's why winter became my ice cream season."

    However, `things go the opposite way` if I have to `go out for work` or other `commitments`. I dislike the feeling of getting wet and the `inconvenience` it can bring, such as traffic jams or `muddy sidewalks.`”
    
- ***Does it rain much in your city?***
    
    "Yes, it does rain `quite a bit` in my city. Guangzhou is a southern city with a humid climate, and `on average`, `we get rain` about two to three times a week. During typhoon season or in summer, the rainfall `can be even more frequent.”`

- ***Have you cancel any plans because of rain?***

- ***Have you ever learnt any foreign languages in school?***
    
    In China, English is `a compulsory subject` during `fundamental education`. Additionally, during my college years, I learned French as a part of my major, this was because my major was co-established by the French government, and some of our courses were taught by French professors. As a result, we were required to take French language courses `alongside the major subjects`.”
    
- ***Do you think it's difficult to learn a new language?***
    
    Well, I find learning a new language quite challenging, especially `when it comes to speaking part`. I'm not a `talkative` person, `even in my native language`. But as you know, speaking requires `constant practice` and interaction with others to `improve proficiency`, so it can be more difficult for me. Additionally, speaking `involves a lot of factors to consider` `beyond` just spelling and grammar. You have to `apply everything you know about the language in real-time situations`, and have less time to think and react. 
    
- ***What aspect of English do you find the least difficult***
    
    "I find reading to be the least challenging aspect of English. I can read quickly in Chinese, and I've noticed that some reading `techniques` `apply to other languages as wel`l. Since I enjoy reading, I regularly practice it `out of personal interest,` which I believe has significantly improved my reading proficiency.”
    
- ***Will you learn another language in the future?***
    
    "I would like to `improve my knowledge of Japanese`if possible. I have a basic understanding because I taught myself a bit during my college days. I'm passionate about Japanese culture and society, and I hope to live there for a while in the future. So, `having proficiency in Japanese` would `undoubtedly` be beneficial for me.”
    
- ***Why do people learn foreign languages?***
    
    I believe there are two primary `motivations`. The first one is `seeking to enhance career prospects`. Learning a foreign language can `open up opportunities` to work abroad or improve communication with international clients, which is increasingly important in today's globalized world. And `the second is for educational purposes`, particularly when studying abroad. `Proficiency in the language` is crucial for understanding coursework and achieving academic success.”
    
- ***Do you think learning a second language is important?***
    
    YES, because it offers various benefits, both in terms of career advancement and personal growth. It can enhance one's competitiveness in today's global job market, many employers value employees who `can communicate in multiple languages`, as it opens up opportunities for international collaboration. Additionally, it broadens one's horizons, fostering a deeper understanding of different cultures and perspectives, which can be `enriching on a personal level.`”
    
- ***How long have you been learning English***
    
    "I began learning English in primary school, but I started to `take it more seriously` during my college years. `The reason for this shift in focus` was `the increasing need for English` in `my field of study`. Many of the primary research papers and materials in my area are written in English, and proficiency in the language enabled me to `delve deeper into` my major subject and gain a broader perspective.”
    
- ***What do you think is the best way to study English***
    
    "I believe the most effective way to study English is by `immersing oneself in an English-speaking environment`. This `forces` individuals to learn the language `comprehensively`. Additionally, being surrounded by native speakers facilitates well-rounded English language proficiency as it provides `ample` opportunities for practice.”

Do not overwork or `overextend oneself for the sake of one's job`. Health should be `a priority at any age`, not just something to consider when we're older.

Reading is a `solitary` activity for me, but I find it relaxing and intellectually `stimulating`.
    
- ***Do you like to go out in the evenings and with whom?***
    
    `I don’t have much interest in` socializing, and I also have an alcohol allergy, so I don't frequent bars or pubs. After work, I typically prefer to `head straight home`. `I'd rather` spend my evenings at home with my wife than `wander around outside`.”
    
- ***What do people today usually like to do after work?***
    
    "Well, people's preferences after work can vary `quite a bit`. Some enjoy going to a bar for drinks and socializing, while others prefer going for a `post-dinner walk`. Then there are those who like to relax at home, either watching TV, playing games, or reading. Additionally, some individuals use their free time to study or `engage in personal development activities`. So, it really depends on the individual and `their interests`.”
    
- ***What do you like to do after work.***
    
    "After a day at work, I enjoy unwinding and relaxing. One of my favorite activities is playing video games; it helps me relax and `destress`. I also like spending quality time with my wife, `whether it's` watching movies or TV shows together at home `or` occasionally `going out for a nice dinner`. It's a great way for us to connect and `enjoy each other's company`. Additionally, I find it essential to stay `physically active`, so I `make an effort to` go to the gym `a few times` a week to `stay fit and healthy`. Overall, it's a balance of leisure activities and self-care that I find fulfilling after work.”
    
- ***What do you do in your spare time? How do you arrange your spare time***

- ***What do Chinese people do in their spare time.***
    
    "Chinese people engage in a variety of activities during their free time. Some enjoy fishing, playing cards, `going on road trips`, playing video games, or `dedicating their spare time to` learning and personal development.”
    
- ***Do you think spare time is important to you.***
    
    Yes, spare time is quite important to me. While `I value work and my career greatly`, having spare time allows me to `cultivate hobbies,` relax, and maintain a well-rounded and healthy work-life balance. This balance, in turn, can facilitate my career endeavors.”
    
- ***Do you feel lonely if you stay at home for a long time.***
    
    "No, I don't feel lonely when I stay at home `for extended periods`. In fact, `I'm not very social by nature`, and being alone allows me to `focus better on` the things I enjoy doing. For instance, during one `summer break` in college, I stayed alone in my dormitory for three months, and `during that time`, I was able to efficiently learn Japanese and programming.”
    

### Holiday(-td)

Moreover, it has taught me valuable skills in terms of `composition`, lighting, and editing, which I believe can be applied to various aspects of life.”
    
- ***Did you have other hobbies when you were younger***
    
    "Well, `during my time in college`, I `did dabble in playing` the `electric guitar` for a while. However, I didn't `stick with it for long`, and to be honest, I've pretty much forgotten how to play it now.
    
- ***If you had more free time, what would you do***
    
    "If I had more free time, I would love to travel to different places and capture unique subjects in my `photographs`. Recently, `I've been planning a trip to` Hokkaido for the winter.

### Relax

- ***How do you relax***
    
    Well, `I have a few different ways to relax`. One of my favorite ways is playing video games. It's a great way to unwind and escape from the stresses of the day. I also enjoy going for a run. Running not only helps me `stay physically fit` but also `clears my mind` and lets me enjoy the outdoors. Additionally, I find relaxation in photography. Capturing beautiful moments and scenes through my camera lens is not only a hobby but a creative outlet for me.
    
- ***How do Chinese people relax, How do people around you relax***
    
    "`it really varies from person to person`. `Many of my friends` are into `electronic gaming`, especially `with the popularity of` mobile games nowadays. Others enjoy more traditional pastimes like fishing or playing cards. Additionally, `quite a few people` I know like to stay active and go to the gym for exercise. So, it really varies from person to person.”
    
- ***How do Chinese young people differ from the old in their ways of relaxing?***
    
    "While the older generation might prefer traditional leisure activities, such as `taking long trips` or spending extended hours enjoying a meal with family and friends, the younger generation tends to `opt for` more efficient and time-effective ways to unwind due to being busier with their work and studies. They often `turn to` shorter and more immediate forms of relaxation, such as watching movies or TV shows, engaging in recreational activities, or `working out at the gym.`”
    

### Music & Instrument

- ***Do you like music? What type of music do you like.***
    
    `I guess so`, I often listen to music while I work and when I'm driving.  As for my musical preferences, `I listen to a variety of genres`, but I find myself `gravitating towards` instrumental music and rock the most.”
    
- ***What kind of music is popular now in China***
    
    Well, `I'm not entirely sure` because I mainly listen to a lot of Japanese and English music, so `I haven't paid much attention to` `what everyone else is listening to` in China. (They could be into)Maybe pop, hip-hop, or traditional Chinese music. I don’t know (I'm not certain.)
    
- ***How does music affect people’s lives***
    
    `For me personally(speaking from my own experience),` music can help regulate one’s mood and state of mind. When `I'm at work`, I often listen to soft and `soothing` instrumental music. It helps me to stay focused, reduce stress, and create a calm and productive atmosphere. On the other hand, when I'm exercising, I prefer `listening to` `upbeat and energetic(fast-paced)` rock or pop music as it `boosts my energy` and `keeps me motivated`
    
- ***What kind of music do young people like***
    
    "Well, `it is hard to generalize`, but `based on what I've observed` and `the recommendations from music apps`, it seems that young people tend to `gravitate towards` pop and rock music more often.”
    
- ***What kind of music do old people like***
    
    Well, I can't say I have a lot of personal experience in this area since I don't often interact with older individuals. However, `based on some common stereotypes`, I guess they might prefer classical music or traditional `folk music`.
    
- ***Have you learned to play any musical instrument***
    
    "Yes, I did `dabble in` playing the `electric guitar` during my college years, but I didn't stick with it, and now `I've pretty much forgotten how to play`.”
    
- ***Have you taken any classes on musical instruments in school?***
    
    Yes, in primary school, we had music classes where we were taught to play the `flute`, and I believe it was because our music teacher herself was skilled in playing this instrument.
    
- ***Do you think students should learn to play musical instruments at school?***
    
    "I believe it can be beneficial for students to have the opportunity to learn to play musical instruments at school. `It's not necessarily about`(It may not be necessary for ) making it `mandatory` for every student to `become proficient in` an certain instrument, but rather about providing them with a chance to gain an understanding of music, enhance their `aesthetic appreciation` and `add enjoyment to` their lives.”
    
- ***Which musical instrument do you like?***
    
    "I'm particularly fond of the electric guitar. The reason behind this preference is my deep admiration for a Japanese rock band that I'm a huge fan of. Many of their songs feature mesmerizing electric guitar solos, which I find incredibly cool and captivating.
    
- ***How easy would it be to learn to play a musical instrument without a teacher?***
    
    "It can be quite challenging. I personally learned to play the electric guitar through `self-study` using online videos. However, `I often found myself uncertain about` whether I was doing everything correctly. Having a teacher to guide me `would have been` really `helpful in` correcting any errors and `providing structured lessons`.”
    

### Dance

    "`Based on the people I've interacted with`, `it seems that` dancing is not particularly common among Chinese people. Personally, I don't engage in dancing either.”

- ***What are the difference between the dances the old people like and the dances the young ***people like.
    
    "Young people tend to enjoy fast-paced, energetic dances with `flashy moves`, often involving popular music and trends. On the other hand, older individuals might prefer slower, more traditional dances that `promote social interaction and connection`
    
- ***Is dancing important to Chinese people.***
    
    "I believe that dance is important to people in many countries, `and China is no exception`. `In ancient times,` dance played a significant role in important `rituals` and `celebrations`. Many traditional dances `have been passed down through` generations and have become `a vital cultural heritage` in China.
    

### Sports

- ***What sports do you like. / What is your favorite sport?***
    
    I really enjoy running; `I've been consistently running for ~~a little~~ over two years now`. I usually `go for a run` in the morning before `starting my day`, and it gives me a lot of energy and `a sense of accomplishment.`”
    
- ***Why do you like it so much***
    
    "I like it so much because i`t doesn't require much equipment` or `a specific location`, so it allows me to run `anytime, anywhere, as long as I want to`. This makes it easier to `stick with`.”
    
- ***Are there any sports facilities near your home***
    
    Yes, there are several sports facilities near my home, including a few gyms and swimming pools. I've visited some of them, but I found that they tend to be quite crowded, and `at times`, you `might even have to wait in line to` use certain equipment. `Because of this`, I haven't become a member of them.
    
- ***How do sports affect people’s lives***
    
    "I believe it helps enhance individuals' `physical fitness` and overall health. Regular exercise can `lower the risk of various diseases`, such as `obesity`, heart disease, and `diabetes`, while also promoting greater `stamina` and strength. Sports can have a profound impact on mental well-being as well. Many people, myself included(including myself), experience `a sense of refreshment` and `stress relief` `after a good workout`.”

    "Yes, I consider it to be excellent physical exercise that not only `strengthens my body` but also helps `build one's perseverance.`”
    
- ***Why so many people ride bikes in China***
    
    "`I suppose the main reason is that` bikes are affordable, so every family can easily buy at least one. Moreover, bicycles `are a convenient way to navigate through heavy traffic and narrow streets`. It is an `eco-friendly mode of transportation` as well and can promote a healthy lifestyle.”
    
- ***`What differences are there between` the views of the old and the young toward bikes.***
    
    "For many older individuals, bikes `are` primarily `seen as` `a practical means of transportation`, while young people often have a different perspective. For them, bikes can `serve` not only `as` `a mode of transport` but also as a `recreational activity` and a form of exercise. Many young individuals see biking as a hobby and a way to enjoy outdoor activities, stay fit, and even as `a way of socializing`.”
    
- ***Have you ever ridden in a boat***
    
    "No, `I haven't had the opportunity` to `ride in a boat` myself. I've only seen `boat races` on TV.”
    

### Daily life/ Routine

- ***When do you usually get up / go to bed***
    
    I usually wake up at 9:00 AM `on weekdays` and `arrive at my workplace by 10:30 AM`. I go to bed `around midnight`. On weekends, I take a break `from my busy weekday routine`, and I don't `set an alarm` because I would stay up late playing games or watching series `the night before.”`
    
- ***Are your weekday and weekend routines different.***
    
    Well, my weekday routine `is quite distinct from` my weekends. On weekdays, I have a fixed schedule. `I start work` at 10:30 in the morning and `don't return until after 8:30 in the evening`. During this time, I'm completely immersed in my work. The weekdays are pretty `hectic`, and `I don't have much flexibility in terms of my time.`
    
    However, `weekends are a different story`. `I have a lot more control over my time`. There's no fixed schedule to follow, so I use weekends as an opportunity to `unwind and de-stress from the workweek`. I might `catch up on sleep`, spend time with family and friends, or engage in activities I enjoy. It's a chance for me to `recharge` and `get into a positive mindset for the upcoming workweek`. ~~So, yes, my weekday and weekend routines are definitely different, and I value the balance they provide in my life.”~~
    
- ***What is your favorite part of the day***
    
    "My favorite part of the day is `late evening`. I appreciate the `tranquility` that comes with it; the quiet environment helps me concentrate better. `This is when I often choose to work on` and study things `I'm passionate about`, as it allows me to focus without `distractions`.”
    
- ***What is the worst part of the day***
    
    "`For me`, the worst part of the day is `around noon`. It's when I `experience my lowest efficiency levels`, and I often feel `fatigued` and find it hard to concentrate. `To cope with this`, I tend to drink a lot of coffee and `have a lighter lunch` to try to `combat that sluggish feeling.`”
    
- ***What part of the day do you work with the most efficiency***
    
    "`I am most efficient` during the late evening. I find it easier to concentrate at that time, probably because it's quite quiet. I enjoy the `ambiance` when everyone `is asleep`, and there are no distractions. `I've had a habit of` working or studying `during these hours` `since my college days.”`
    

### Transport

- ***Which kind of transport do you usually use?***
    
    "I prefer to walk. I currently rent a place close to my workplace(I `rent accommodation` near my workplace), which allows me to walk there regardless of the weather or traffic(`regardless of weather conditions or traffic congestion`). This also gives me more time to rest and `less time spent on commuting.`”
    
- ***What is the public transport like in your city?***
    
    "In Guangzhou, public transportation is extensive and diverse, encompassing buses, trams, subways, and ferries. The subway system is the preferred choice for most people due to its reliability and `predictable travel times`, which are crucial for `commuters`. `Opting to drive or take the bus`(opting for driving or taking the bus) may result in traffic jams that could potentially make them late.”
    
- ***When are these forms of transport most crowded.***
    
    "Generally speaking, there are two primary rush hours each day: one occurs in the morning, typically between 7 and 9, and the other `takes place in the evening`, usually between 5 and 8. This is because most people commute to work and return home during these two time frames.”(one in the morning, usually from 7 to 9, and the other in the evening, typically between 5 and 8. This is because most people `commute to and from work` `during these times.`”)
    

### Restaurant

- ***How often do you go to restaurant? How often do you eat out?***
    
    "I typically dine at a restaurant about once a week. My wife and I have a tradition of going out for a nice meal on the weekends to `unwind and reward ourselves after a week of hard work`. It's a chance for us to relax, enjoy some good food, and maybe `catch a movie afterwards`, which `has become a cherished routine for us.”`
    
- ***What is your favorite food***
    
    "My favorite food would definitely be roasted ribs, `whether it's beef or pork`, `I enjoy both equally`. I'm quite the meat enthusiast, savoring the rich flavors and `tenderness` of roasted ribs. The `aroma and taste` are simply `irresistible`. The only exception is lamb; I'm not particularly fond of its distinct smell
    
- ***Do chinese people often go to restaurants***
    
    "Yes, Chinese people frequently visit restaurants. `Dining out` is not just about food; it's also a significant social activity in Chinese culture. It's common for friends and families to `gather at` restaurants to bond and `celebrate special occasions`. Additionally, Chinese cuisine is incredibly diverse, with `many regional specialties` that can be challenging to `replicate` at home(require specialized skills or equipment that are not readily available in home kitchens). So, for an authentic culinary experience and the convenience of enjoying these unique dishes, people often choose to dine in restaurants.”
    

### Photography, Memories

- ***Do you like photography and why***
    
    "Yes, I do enjoy photography. My interest in photography dates back to high school when I `stumbled upon`(came across/encountered) a `biography` of a `battlefield photographer`. I was instantly `captivated` by the idea of capturing moments in such a powerful and `tangible` way. ~~Photography allows me to record not just scenes, but also emotions and meanings that can deeply `resonate with` others.~~ It's a `medium` that `has the potential` to convey strong emotions and stories, which is why I find it so fascinating.”
    
- ***When did you start to like photography***
    
    I `developed a passion for` photography back in high school. It all began when I stumbled upon a biography of a battlefield journalist. I was deeply inspired by his courage and his ability to capture powerful moments through his camera lens. That's when I decided to pick up a camera myself and start capturing meaningful and `impactful` photographs.”
    
- ***Do you keep your old photos***
    
    "Yes, I do keep my old photos. Even though I started taking pictures during `the digital camera era` when most people didn't print physical photos, `I've been storing` a large collection of photos on my computer(`hard drives`) and in iCloud since my high school years. These photos capture a wide range of moments and memories, and I consider them to be `precious` `keepsakes`."
    
- ***Do you like to take pictures as souvenirs or buy souvenirs.***
    
    "I don't see them as conflicting choices, actually. I enjoy both taking photos and buying souvenirs, and `it depends on the situation`. I like to capture moments through photography, especially if I find something particularly meaningful or unique. I also enjoy buying souvenirs, such as postcards or local `handicrafts`, to share a piece of the culture or place with my family and friends. So, `it's a mix of both for me`, depending on what `resonates with` me during my travels.”
    

### Wedding

- ***What is a typical Chinese wedding like.***
    
    "A typical Chinese wedding is a significant cultural event, often `held on a specific date` chosen according to the Chinese Lunar Calendar to `bring good fortune and protection to the couple`. Family and friends are invited to join in the celebration, usually at a restaurant or `banquet hall`, where various `rituals` take place. During the ceremony, the couple is `officially pronounced as married`, and they `receive blessings` from the guests.
    
    In recent years, some couples have started to opt for more personalized and memorable wedding experiences. They might choose to have `a destination wedding` with `a smaller group of close friends and family`, making the occasion even more special."
    
- ***What people are usually involved***
    
    "Typically, `extended family members from both sides` are involved, as well as friends and classmates of the couple. However, nowadays, some new couples prefer a smaller circle of family and friends `compared to traditional customs.`”
    
- ***What clothes do people usually wear.***
    
    It mainly depends on the couple's preferences and the type of wedding they're having. In some cases, the couple may opt for a more casual and relaxed wedding, where guests are expected to dress decently `but not necessarily in formal attire`. While there are some families who `place a strong emphasis on` tradition and `formality`. `In such cases`, guests are often expected to wear formal attire, and `in some instances`, they may even be encouraged to `wear traditional clothing`, although this is less common. 
    
- ***Are wedding important in China***
    
    Absolutely, weddings `hold immense significance in` China. `According to Chinese customs`, `they are among the most crucial events in a person's life`. It is not only a celebration of the couple's relationship but also a way to `establish a deep bond between two families`, and Chinese people place great importance on families and traditions. This cultural perspective adds significant meaning and weight to weddings here.”
    

### Time/Watch

- ***Do you wear a watch***
    
    "If the Apple Watch `can be considered a watch`, yes, I wear one. I bought it last year for `fitness purposes`, such as monitoring my physical condition and `recording outcomes during workouts`.”
    
- ***Do you think it is important to be on time.***
    
    "Yes, I value it very much. The education I received taught me the significance of `punctuality`. Today's world `operates at a high pace`, and nobody likes waiting. Therefore, being punctual can `showcase` one's `professionalism` and `good manners to other people`, which can be very beneficial `in any setting`.”
    
- ***How do you feel when you are late for an appointment.***
    
    "I would feel deeply sorry for `those who are concerned` because `they are all exposed to potential losses due to my personal mistake`. If, unfortunately, `such a situation were to occur`, I would promptly inform them to `minimize their losses` and offer a sincere apology `afterward`.”
    
- ***How do you feel when others are late.***
    
    "Honestly, most of the time, I would be annoyed and even angry because I highly value punctuality and always `strive to stick to my well-planned schedule`. However, if someone were late due to `unforeseeable circumstances` or `force majeure` factors, I would try to be `understanding` and hope they don't feel too bad about it.”
    

### Shopping

- ***Do you like shopping / window shopping***
    
    "No, I only go to malls or shops when I have `specific purposes in mind`. In such cases, I often `research the details` online `beforehand` and visit the mall to try them on and `make purchases`. My wife says `I'm too focused on my goals` and `miss out` on the joy of window shopping.”
    
- ***Where do you often go to shop and with whom***
    
    "I'd like to go to large shopping centers because `they have most of the shops I'd like to visit`, which makes `going out` more efficient. Typically, I go shopping with my wife,  as there are also restaurants and cinemas in the big shopping mall, it's a great way to `make the most of` our weekends.”
    
- ***How often do you go shopping in a week.***
    
    `There is no fixed pattern`; I would go there as long as there are some `new goods that interest me`. `If I were to estimate a frequency`, it might be at most once a week.”
    
- ***Do you usually do your shopping at one place or at different places.***
    
    "I usually prefer `visiting a specific place` because I find it more convenient and time-efficient. Since I'm already familiar with this store, and as long as it can offer a wide range of products I need, `I see no reason to explore other options."`
    
- ***What kinds of shops are there near your home?***
    
    "Unfortunately, I live in `a purely residential area` that `has almost no shops nearby`, `except for` a few `convenience stores`. My wife and I always go to a large mall about 7 km `away from` our flat.”
    
- ***Do you  pay more attention to price or quality***
    
    "I prioritize quality because I try to `lead a practical and minimalist lifestyle`. I `strive to` purchase only necessary items that are `of good quality` and user-friendly. `I hold the opinion` that if people buy something `at a bargain price` but don't use it frequently or `struggle to use it`, then it is not a bargain but just `a waste of both time and money`.”
    

### Clothing

- ***What kind of clothes do you like***
    
    "In the workplace, I prefer comfortable and functional clothing, as the technology companies I work for `have no specific dress code`. However, I also have some `formal attire` like `tailored suits` for special occasions such as weddings or formal meetings.”
    
- ***How do you get information about fashion.***
    
    "I guess `I'm not really into` that myself, but my mom subscribes to some `magazines` about `dressing and makeup`. So, I think reading `paper prints` and maybe following some `fashion influencers` on social media (SSM) would be good ways to `stay updated on` fashion trends.”
    
- ***How do older people feel about younger people’s clothing.***
    
    "It really depends. Some older people might see them `unconventional and even outlandish`, but my mom, for example, used to play the guitar when she was in college, and she is more inclusive than many parents. I suppose she can easily accept some `outlandish` `clothing choices` of younger people. Anyway, `people should be free to choose their clothing`, and `there is no need or right to express personal opinions about` others' choices as long as it is `within the boundaries of the law`.”
    
- ***What kind of clothes do children usually wear.***
    
    Most of them I encounter(can get access to) these days are wearing school uniforms, and I think it is good because it saves `a lot of time` of choosing clothing and can avoid the impulse to show off to peers among children. ~~But there are also opposite views say that it stifles children’s personalities, and I think it has reasons to some extent, anyway, every coin has two sides.~~
    
- ***What are the most fashionable clothes in China now***
    
    "`I guess I have no right to comment on this issue` since I really `know little about` fashion and clothes. "However, `there does seem to be a trend of` people wearing sports and fitness clothes, especially in big cities. I think this might be because the growing awareness of fitness and `an active lifestyle` among the residents in these urban areas.”
    

### News and Media

- ***How do you get the latest news.***
    
    "Personally, I prefer to use news apps and visit `streaming websites`. I `access` them `during my breakfast and commute`; They are very convenient and comprehensive. You can `subscribe to the aspects` `you are most interested in` and `receive notifications` when there is new information. Chatting with colleagues and friends during lunch is also a primary way for me to `stay informed about` the news.”
    
- ***What kinds of news are usually reported on TV in your country***
    
    "To be honest, `I haven't been watching TV much lately`, but I do `recall` that television in my country typically covers a wide range of news topics. You can find news on `economics`, sports, entertainment, `domestic affairs`, and international events on different channels. `I think this is still the case.”`
    
- ***Do you pay more attention to local, national or international news.***
    
    I tend to `focus more on` international news. I often watch news from Japan, Korea, and Russia because they are our `geographic neighbors`. Additionally, I `pay close attention to` news from the United States. You know, it's the most advanced and influential country in the world, and events there can have a significant impact globally, after all.”
    
- ***Which do you prefer, TV or radio***
    
    "I would say radio. `There are several specific channels` I have been listening to(`tuning into)` for many years. It’s mainly because I like the style and ideas of their hosts , maybe even `more than the news itself.` Their `interpretations` and insights hold more value to me.”
    

### Letter

- ***Do you often write letters.***
    
    "If you `are referring to` traditional paper letters that would be posted by post offices, no, `I hardly write any`. But if you are `talking in a broader sense`, ~~including forms like email, yes,~~ I write emails every day.”
    
- ***Whom do you often write and what do you often write about***
    
    "I primarily use it for `business-related purposes`, mainly `corresponding with` my colleagues and business partners. The main content typically `revolves around` `work-related updates`, such as progress reports and project discussions. Occasionally, I also write to friends and family `for personal matters`, like `catching up` ~~gossips~~ or sharing experiences.”
    
- ***Do you prefer to write letters or e-mails.***
    
    "I definitely prefer emails. It's hard to find reasons to write paper letters in today's society because it's slow and `cumbersome`(troublesome). `What's even more inconvenient` is that sometimes letters fail to reach their `recipient` due to mistakes by `postal services`. In contrast, emails are convenient, reliable, and easy to manage and organize as most email services support `categorizing incoming mails` and `keeping communication records.”`
    

### Film

- ***Do you like to watch films.***
    
    Yes, watching movies is a primary way for me to spend leisure time. I often go to the cinema to `catch` `newly released movies`, and I also have `quite a collection` of `Blu-ray discs` `featuring` classic films like 'Titanic' and 'The Godfather.’
    
- ***What kind of film do you like to watch? what is your favorite kind of film***
    
    "I think it should be `drama and documentary` films. A well-crafted script can `immerse` the audience completely `into` the story. Compared to action or thriller genres, these genres can `evoke more emotions` and deep(`profound`) thinking, which is why people are inclined to watch them `over and over again.”`
    
- ***What kinds of films are popular in your country***
    
    "In my country, comedies and action movies tend to be quite popular. From a business perspective, these genres provide instant(immediate) and immersive(tangible) `sensory experiences`, making them `a preferred choice for entertainment` among the majority of people. `It's no wonder that` they attract the `widest` audience compared to other genres.”
    
- ***Who is your favorite movie star***
    
    "I would say Leslie Cheung. He was a well-known Hong Kong actor and singer, incredibly `versatile`. He `excelled at capturing the inner thoughts and characteristics of his roles` and `delivering subtle performances on screen`. He was also a brave individual who `fought` with severe `melancholia` for years. Unfortunately, he `ultimately` `took his own life` due to this terrible `mental illness`, but his works and experiences continue to inspire and encourage many people.”
    
- ***Do you like to watch films at the cinema or home.***
    
    "It depends on the type of film. If it's a movie with impressive sensory experiences, like strong `sound effects and 3D visuals`, I prefer watching it in `a well-equipped cinema` to get `the full immersive experience`. If not, I think watching at home could be more comfortable and free, like You can pause the film whenever you need and `choose a comfortable posture.`”
    

### Animals

- ***Do you like animals***
    
    "Yes, `I have a deep passion for` animals. I have been fond of watching animal-related TV programs since I was a primary school student, and `I still love them today`. I have collected `a significant number of` DVDs of animal documentaries filmed by the BBC and National Geographic Channel.”
    
- ***Do you like going to the zoo***
    
    "Yes, there is a large zoo in the city where I live, and it is `well-maintained`. It `houses` a `wide variety of` animals and offers excellent `amenities` for tourists. My wife and I purchased `annual passes` because we often visit there and it would be more cost-effective.
    
- ***What pet is most popular in your country***
    
    "It depends on the area I think, in metropolitan areas, cats should be the preferred choice as they are `indoor animals` and would clean themselves regularly, making them easier to `take care of`(care for). Because, you know, `taking dogs for walks` can be `burdensome` for busy people living a fast-paced life. However, `in the countryside(rural areas)`, dogs are `predominant(prevalent)` because there is enough open space for them to `run around(roam)`, and rural families rely on them for warning and guarding their houses and yards.”
    
- ***Do any people close to you keep pets***
    
    Yes, many of my friends and colleagues `keep(own) cats or dogs` as pets. In fact, I have a british shorthair cat as pet myself, she is about half-year old `weighs 3 kilos`. `she is good-looking and` has nice `characteristics`, when i’m working at home, she always quietly `stays around me to accompany me`, makes me feel so warm, My wife and I `adopted` her 5 months ago and she has become a very important member in our family, we `adore` her so much. Besides, many of my colleagues pet cats, as I mentioned before, they are very suitble for people living in big cities, and can `provide effective emotional support` for current young people. 
    
- ***Do you like birds***
    
    "I don't dislike them and sometimes find `some breeds of them` adorable, but I do find them a bit annoying when they `leave droppings on` my balcony or clothes.”
    
- ***Describle a kind of bird that appears near your home***
    
    "There are sparrows that often appear near my apartment. These little birds have become `a regular sight and sound` in my daily life. They've chosen to nest in the nearby trees, and every morning, `I wake up to the delightful sound of their cheerful singing`. It's a wonderful connection to nature. I find these little creatures adorable, although there is a minor inconvenience when they occasionally leave droppings on my balcony.”
    
- ***What are the popular birds in China.***
    
    "To be honest, `I don't know much about birds`. However, some of my friends often talk to me about `parrots` because, you know, they are quite interesting pets as they can `imitate` human speech, so I `assume` they are quite popular in China.”
    
- ***What special meanings do birds have***
    
    "In my country, `certain birds do hold special meanings`. For instance, `swallows` `are often seen as a symbol of the arrival of spring`. `Magpies` are considered a sign of good luck and happiness, primarily due to their unique singing sounds. Additionally, `cranes` `are highly regarded` and `symbolize holiness` because they were believed to be the pets of `immortals` in ancient Chinese `myths`.”
    
- ***How should we protect birds***
    
    "There are various ways to protect them, such as `introducing` wildlife protection laws, establishing protected habitats in cities, and educating people about the benefits of `coexisting` with birds. Anyway, `it should call for collaborative efforts` from individuals, communities, organizations, and governments.”
    
- ***Do you like flowers***
    
    "Well, `it's a bit of a mixed feeling for me`. I enjoy looking at them in photos and videos, but `I'm afraid to get close to real flowers` because I'm allergic to some types of them, and it `causes me a lot of discomfort` after touching them.”
    
- ***What are the most popular flowers in China***
    
    "In the past, `peonies` were the most popular flowers in China because they `symbolized wealth and good health` in traditional Chinese culture. They were commonly `featured` `in various forms of` art and `craftsmanship`. However, `in recent times`, roses `have gained significant popularity`, especially among younger generations. Roses are often chosen as gifts on special occasions like `Valentine's` Day due to `their romantic connotations`.
    
- ***On what occasions do Chinese people send flowers to others.***
    
    I’m not very familiar with this aspect, `but based on my personal observations`, people send flowers `at weddings`, when `visiting people in the hospital`, and to celebrate birthdays. Additionally, we send roses to `loved ones` on Valentine's Day and `marriage anniversaries`, and `carnations` are often given to mothers on Mother's Day.”
    
- ***What special meanings do flowers have***
    
    "`As far as I know`, peonies represent wealth and health in Chinese traditional culture and are therefore very popular. Chinese people see `daisies` `as a symbol of purity for some reason`, perhaps due to their white color. `Like in other countries`, roses are regarded as symbols of love and romance, which are becoming increasingly popular among young generations in my country.”
    

### Keeping fit

- ***Do you try to keep fit***
    
    Yes, `I care more and more about` my `physical fitness` in recent years, I've been going to the gym and running regularly for several years. And I avoid eating unhealthy foods such as fried snacks, `alcohol`, and soft drinks with a lot of sugar.”
    
- ***Is keeping fit popular in China***
    
    "Yes, `it has been gaining popularity` in recent years, especially `in metropolitan areas.` I believe this is because `there has been an increased` `awareness of the importance of staying fit`. People have noticed that their physical fitness `is declining` due to `their fast-paced lifestyles` and want to `make up for it`.”
    
- ***Is keeping fit more important for men or women***
    
    "`It is unfair to generalize` and say that `it is more significant for one gender than the other`. `It is a universal priority for both sides`. However, when discussing fitness goals and the approach to achieving them, it may vary among individuals. Some people might prioritize `losing weight` and choose `aerobic` exercises, while others may focus on `muscle-building` and `opt for` `equipment training`.”
    
- ***How do Chinese people usually exercise***
    
    "Chinese people `engage in various forms of exercise` to `stay fit`. Activities like running, yoga, and `using exercise equipment` `are all very common`. It's challenging to determine which one is `generally the most popular`. However, `I've recently noticed` `an increasing number of people` `going to fitness centers` and working out.”
    

# Task-3

## People

### Successful People

- ***Do you think a successful person can be popular at the same time?***
    
    "My answer is yes; in fact, you can often find that many successful individuals are `indeed` popular in today's world. `If we look at figures` like Elon Musk or Donald Trump, they `have massive followings on Twitter`, even larger than most `entertainment celebrities`. I guess it is mainly because many people `aspire to` be as wealthy and `influential` as they are, so they `look up to` these successful individuals `as role models`.”
    
- ***Which one is more important? Being popular or having good grades?***
    
    "For me, it would be having good grades. In China, to some extent, it is a `diploma-oriented` society, where entering a `prestigious` university holds significant value. This `opens doors to` better job opportunities, higher `income potential`, and access to `influential and supportive networks`. `These are all` tangible and appealing benefits.”
    
- ***Do you think students who do well in academic study will be become successful later in ***life?
    
    "`I think they are to some extent relevant`, but it's not `an absolute guarantee`, because we often see that some students `may not perform very well in their studies` but `still` `achieve great success` `through` their individual talents, personalities, `and the opportunities they encounter`. Of course, it's commonly believed that doing well in academic studies certainly `provides a strong foundation` and can open doors, `but it doesn't mean this is the only path` to success.”
    
- ***Do you think rich people are successful?***
- 
    Yes, I believe that rich people `can be considered successful`, especially if `they have earned their wealth` through hard work and dedication. In my opinion, `wealth can be viewed as one of the metrics of success` because I am personally familiar with `the effort it takes to earn a substantial income`. `But I'm not saying that` wealth is the only metric; there are various forms of success in the world, and wealth `happens to be a commonly recognized one of them`.”

- ***Do you think it is easier for people to become successful nowadays than in the past?***
    
    Generally speaking, my answer is yes, because nowadays, people can access `a wealth of` information that `used to be limited to a privileged group`. This `brings about more knowledge` and possibilities for success. Additionally, as you know(`as you may be aware`), `the pace of life` in our modern society is much faster `than in the past`, `constant advancements and innovations are happening` `all the time`, and I think this more `dynamic environment` offers people more `chances` to `start their own businesses` and pursue their goals.
    
- ***What do people need to sacrifice in order to be successful?***
    
    `It can vary from person to person`, but `for the most part`, it involves time spent with families, pursuing personal interests, and rest. In most cases, Achieving one's goals demands a significant amount of effort and time, `which is limited to everyone`. If you spend more time `on work` then you have less left to your personal life and leisure activities
    
- ***Are there many family businesses in your country?***
    
    I would say yes, because most Chinese people believe that `families are the most reliable` when running a business. Therefore, `it's common for` relatives `to hold key management positions within these businesses`. For instance, in `the culinary industry`, which is a significant part of the Chinese economy, many restaurants are `family-owned and operated`. Skills and expertise in cooking and managing these `establishments` are often `passed down through generations`. However, this approach has some obvious drawbacks, such as `placing emphasis on loyalty over ability` and expertise can lower the competitiveness of these family businesses. That's why many famous companies decline quickly within 1-2 generations after the founder leaves.”
    
- *** What do you think is the most important quality of an employee?***
    
    It really depends on what profession we are discussing, but I think `integrity` to some extent can `apply to all the cases`, I can't think of any job `having no demand for it`. It `forms the foundation` of trust `in the workplace`, and without trust, it's challenging for any team or individual to function effectively. `Whether` you're a doctor, teacher, engineer, `or in any other profession`, people need to trust that `you'll act honestly`, `responsibly` and `ethically`

### Technology once

- ***What technology do people currently use?***
    
    Nowadays, new technologies are ~~constantly~~ `being put into use` all the time, but `what impresses me the most` in recent years would be the generative AI technology, perhaps you have heard of the chatgpt published by openAI, I have to say that it has greatly influenced the industry I’m working in. Nowadays these brilliant models can `professionally` correct our code and `offer very constructive advice` to `guide our work`. `It's no wonder` some programmers feel the risk of being replaced by these models, but I have to confess that I can tangibly feel that productivity and personal skills have been greatly enhanced by this `technological advancement`.”
    
- ***Why do big companies introduce new products frequently?***
    
    "One reason is that they need to `stay ahead of` their `rivals` by offering fresh and `innovative` products `in today's competitive market`, and demonstrate(showcase) their ability to `adapt to` changing consumer preferences and `technological advancements`. `By doing so`, they can attract and `retain` customers, which can ultimately lead to `increased sales and profits`.”
    
    And it also `caters to` `customers' natural desire for novelty` and can `stimulate` their `purchasing impulse`.
    
- ***Why are people so keen on buying iPhones even though they haven't changed much?***
    
    "One reason is `customers' natural desire for novelty` and maybe`the need to show off to peers`. I develop applications for Apple devices, and I notice that many users do not fully `utilize the extensive features` of their iPhones, and some `are not even aware of` these functions. However, this doesn't `deter` them `from` `upgrading` to the latest edition `each year`. So I guess even if they don't buy a new iPhone, they are likely to purchase something else as long as it is popular and new.”
    
- ***Does the development of technology affect the way we study?***
    
    "Yes, absolutely. `Take myself as an example`. Since I started using generative AI tools, it has become easier for me to learn new programming languages and `acquire` other `work-related knowledge`. I used to spend a lot of time `searching the internet` or reading professional books, but now `it's like having an expert` to answer `all of your technical` problems `at any time` you’d like, and `there is no worry that` you're asking `too many` or too naive questions that may annoy him. So it greatly saves me time and enhances the `efficiency of study process.`”

- ***What are the reasons that make people break rules?***

### Art and Paintings once

- ***Why do some people keep a painting for a long time?***
    
    `One reason I can think of` is for `investment purposes`. Some people purchase paintings at a relatively low price and anticipate an increase in value `over time`, like the artist may become famous in the future, `thereby` the value of their early works may rise significantly, They can `then` sell these paintings `for a remarkable profit`.”
    
- ***Do you think it is important for children to learn painting at school?***
    
    "`I would see it as` a good and beneficial hobby for children to develop. It can boost their imagination and `creativity`, which can be very helpful in other areas `as they grow up.` Even if they `have no aspiration to` become a professional painter, painting still holds significant value in shaping and enhancing one's `aesthetics`.” I think `incorporating` painting into the `curriculum` can provide children with a `well-rounded` education.”
    
- ***Why do some people attach importance to home decoration?***
    
    One reason I can think of is about living experience, you know, our homes are where we `spend a significant portion of our lives` with our families, so making it comfortable and cozy can enhance our overall quality of life. And I gather that home decor plays a crucial role in `expressing the personal style` and `aesthetics preferences` of homeowners, people can showcase their `tastes` through `the choice of furniture`, `color scheme`, and more.
    
- ***Do you think the objects we use in our daily lives should be beautifully designed?***
    
    "Yes, definitely. As someone who works in a design-related profession, I recognize the effort and value of appearance design. It's commonly believed that human aesthetics often `derive from` very `practical considerations`. So in most cases, something that is aesthetically pleasing is `inherently` user-friendly as well. `That's why I care so much about it`, as it can indeed enhance the overall user experience.”
    

### Science

- ***Should children be encouraged to learn science?***
- ***Should people be encouraged to learn science after graduation?***
- ***How do you get to know about scientific news?***
- ***Should scientists explain the research process to the public?***

### Tiredness once

- ***When do people usually feel tired?***
    
    "For me, people usually feel tired after `a full day of dedicated work` or `extended periods of studying`. And, of course, `intensive` physical activities can also quickly `run out of` one's energy and lead to `fatigue`.”
    
- ***What's the difference between tiredness caused by doing sport and study/work?***
    
    "I would say `the former` is purely `physical fatigue`; So`a good night's sleep` can usually `refresh` people as long as they are not `injured`. That's why many people see regular exercise as a way to `reduce daily stress`. On the other hand, I think the mental tiredness from dedicated studying or working can be more difficult to `recover from`; it often requires a longer break, like a weekend or a short vacation, to truly `unwind` and `release the burden.”`
    
- ***How much free time do you think `office workers` should have?***
    
    "I think 2-3 hours per day `during weekdays` would be fine. Because a balanced time `management` `in my mind` would be like 9 hours for sleep, about 10 hours for `work and commuting`, 2 hours for `meals`, and the `remaining time`(rest) should be for personal free time, to relax, pursue hobbies and spend with families and friends. This `distribution` would be ideal for me”
    
- ***Do you think it is easier for people to feel tired today than 40 years ago?***
    
    "`I would agree with this statement` because,  even though many of us `enjoy a higher material standard of living`, most people today are `constantly` `under high pressure` due to `demanding work and studies`. As I mentioned before, mental fatigue is more challenging to recover from. So we often `witness` people `suffering from` mental illnesses caused by this pressure nowadays. There is a `growing trend` of people `moving away from` big cities to lead simpler and more laid-back lifestyles in small towns or the countryside.” And I think this phnomenon is a  `reflection` of a more tired society

### Travel destination once

- ***`Does` tourism `have to do with` cultural exchange?***
    
    "Yes, I think `they are highly connected` because when people travel to different countries, they can `immerse` themselves `in the local culture`. This involves `interactions` with local people, visiting historical sites, participating in cultural activities, etc. `I can't think of a better way to` `gain` a richer and more comprehensive `understanding` of the `host culture`.”
    
    `What's more important is that` this is a `two-way` process, `as` tourists also share their own `customs` and traditions with `the locals` sometimes.”
    
- ***Why do some people think it is enjoyable to stay at home during holidays?***
    
    "I believe `I'm qualified to answer this question` because `I am precisely the type of person you're describing`. The main reason for this is that I dislike crowded environments. In China, tourists can `overcrowd every place during holidays`, making `going out` very `stressful`. Compared to waiting in long lines and `being stuck in traffic congestion`, `I would prefer to` stay at home, playing video games and watching TV series. I think this kind of relaxation can `recharge me better`.”
    
- ***What do you think is the most desirable place for people to visit during holidays?***
    
    "`It is difficult to generalize`, but for me, it would be my home. I can stay at home `all the time`, playing video games, watching TV series, and `surfing the internet`. In China, `attractions` and `famous tourist sites` can become `overcrowded` during holidays, which can make the experience quite `unpleasant`. So, I `wouldn't want to` spend my `precious` holiday time waiting in long lines and `on the way to and from` these places.”
    
- ***Do young people usually travel with friends or alone?***
    
    "It largely depends on individuals' personalities and `the type of experience they seek`. For instance, `I had a college friend` who consistently took `solo` trips `during each summer break`. And his goals were very direct and simple: to `explore stunning landscapes` and `capture them in photos`. On the other hand, I personally prefer traveling with friends because `what matters more to me` is `who I am with` during the trip `rather than the trip itself.”`
    

### Parks and Gardens once

- ***Do you think people should keep parks and gardens clean?***
    
    "Yes, I definitely agree with this. These spaces are `public assets`, so `it's the responsibility of every citizen` to well maintain them. Keeping them clean can provide a better experience to their visitors and can showcase an overall `high quality` of citizens.”
    
- ***Is public parks or gardens popular among people who live in cities?***
    
    As far as I can see, yes, almost everyone hope there is a public garden or park near their residence, because these places can provide them a good place to take a walk after meal or do some exercise like running `at early morning`, and `the abundance of plants` in these areas contributes to `improved air quality`. `If you take a closer look`, the `properties` close to these places are obviously `priced` higher(tend to have higher real estate values), I think it can directly reflect(`underscores`) their popularity.”
    
- ***Why do some people like growing vegetables?***
    
    "I believe I'm qualified to answer this question; I'm exactly the type of person you are describing. During my college years, I used to `grow vegetables` on `a small piece of land` near our dormitory. It is very `fulfilling` to witness the seeds you plant `mature` over time; you can get a sense of accomplishment when you `harvest` them. Additionally, I know that some people believe that `self-grown` vegetables are healthier because `they are under control and away from pollution.”`
    
- ***Do you think people of all ages like to go to parks?***
    
    "Generally speaking, Yes, I believe people `of all ages` enjoy visiting parks. But I have to say it's  `particularly popular among` children and `the elderly`. Children `are drawn to` the `open spaces` and the various `playground equipment` found in parks. Some `vendors` also sell their favorite `snacks` like popcorn and ice creams there. On the other hand, the elderly often prefer `taking leisurely walks` in the park `during the early morning or evening` hours, appreciating `the abundance of plants` and fresh air.”
    
- ***What do old people like to do in parks?***
    
    `Based on what I observe`, they like to `take leisurely walks`, play chess and chat with other `elderly people`. And when there is enough open space, such as a square, you can often see a lot of old people dancing to `music from their era`, it’s a very common and popular exercise and socializing activity in China.

### Driving

- ***What benefit does public transport bring to the society?***
    
    It offers several significant benefits to society. It provides accessible and convenient transportation options for individuals who may not own private vehicles or have limited mobility, allowing them to `explore the area` and `access essential services`. This `inclusivity` promotes social equality and can `boost local economy`. And public transport is `a more efficient mode of transportation`, because `it can carry a larger number of passengers at once`. This reduces traffic `congestion`, lowers air pollution, and contributes to a cleaner environment
    
- ***Is it too late for people to get driving licenses at 18 years old?***
    
    "No, obtaining a driver's license at 18 is an `appropriate` age. `I don't see a need for` getting a driver's license before that age. `If it's for transportation needs`, parents can provide rides or utilize public transport. If it's for employment, such as working as a driver, they may be too young to `take on a full-time job`.”
    
- ***Do you think the government should make it a rule for people to use public transport?***
    
    I believe encouraging the use of public transport can be a beneficial policy, `as it can` help reduce traffic congestion and `lower carbon emissions`. However, making it a `compulsory` rule might not be the best approach. People have diverse needs and `circumstances`, and `there may be situations` where using public transport is not practical or `feasible`.
    
- ***What jobs require people to be good at driving?***
    
    I know that taxi drivers need excellent `driving skills` since they have to be very familiar with the local area to know the quickest(shortest) `routes`, and they must `navigate through` busy city traffic `with ease`. Additionally, `in the transportation industry`, `truck drivers` require strong driving skills. `If you've ever witnessed` the process of a truck driver `loading and unloading cargo`, `you'd be amazed by` their `driving expertise`.

### Gather information

- ***What kinds of websites do you use to acquire information?***
    
    "As a programmer, I often `seek solutions` to `work-related problems` on a website called Stack Overflow. It is a worldwide `technical forum` for IT and computer science `professionals`, where there are quite a few high-quality discussions and answers that can help improve my professional skills. Additionally, I frequently visit news websites published by `traditional outlets` such as The Economist and the `South China Morning Post`. `With the advent of` powerful generative AI tools, `I find myself increasingly asking` questions to ChatGPT.”
    
- ***Why do some people not believe information online?***
    
    "In today's world, the internet has become a vast `repository` of information, including `misinformation` and `fake news`. And there have been `instances` of online `scams` and `rumors`. `It's natural for people to` be cautious and question the (`credibility`)accuracy of what they encounter. I think this skeptical trend is indicative of people's increasing awareness and improvement in critical thinking. They know that publishers could manipulate information for various purposes. This `skepticism`, in some cases, is a healthy response to the `complexities` of the digital age.”
    
- ***What is the influence of incorrect information?***
    
    "It can be very `detrimental` `both for` individuals and `society as a whole`. First, it can `affect` decision-making. People rely on accurate data and facts to `make informed choices`. If the information is incorrect, it can lead to `poor decisions`, causing financial `losses` and `missed opportunities`. In today's digital age, the spread of false information through `social media and online platforms` can `influence public opinion`, impact elections, or even `incite social unrest`, all of these bring about  `far-reaching consequences` for society `overall`.”
    
- ***What kinds of information are often spread through text messages and emails?***
    
    I think they `are widely used for` `staying connected` and managing our personal and professional `affairs`. With the development of those convenient `mobile messaging apps`, people frequently use text messages to exchange `quick updates`, make plans, or stay in touch with friends and family. And in the workplace, We rely on emails for `formal communication`, sharing documents, `scheduling meetings`, and collaborating with colleagues.
    
- ***What kinds of jobs require staff to spread information to others?***
    
    "The jobs I can think of would include `those related to journalism and media`. These `professionals` `disseminate` information to the public through various channels, such as newspapers, television, radio, and `online platforms`. Additionally, `public relations professionals` are involved in conveying information `on behalf of organizations` to `manage their image and reputation`. Furthermore, `educators`, such as teachers and professors , who share knowledge with their students, helping them acquire new skills and insights, `should also be considered as falling into this category`.”

### Saving money

- ***Are you good at saving money?***
    
    "Yes, I think I'm quite good at saving money. I `enrolled in` a financial course during my college years, which helped me understand the importance of `wealth management`. Since then I `consistently` save a portion of my income each month and `invest in` low-risk, long-term `options` like `government bonds` and `fixed deposit` to secure my money and gain stable profits.”
    
- ***Do you think it is hard for people to save money nowadays?***
    
    I would say yes, because the modern world is filled with `enticing` `material temptations` due to the `flourishing consumerism`. Companies `continuously` introduce new products and use `advertising` to encourage people to `make purchases`. As a result, it can sometimes be difficult for people to `resist` the `impulse` to buy and prioritize saving.”
    
- ***Do you think children should have pocket money?***
    
    "I agree with giving children `a reasonable amount of` pocket money, but there is a `precondition` that I believe every child should receive necessary `guidance` `on` how to deal with money. It is better to `develop the right sense of the value of money` in them `at an early age`, and then pocket money would be a good way to start practicing wealth management. This can be very beneficial `for their future lives`.”
    
- ***What do young people save money for?***
    
    It is difficult to generalize as young people spend their money on various aspects, such as pursuing hobbies like photograph or fishing, investing self-education for `a long-term career outcome`, and saving for `major life milestones` like buying houses or cars to `support their future family lives.`
