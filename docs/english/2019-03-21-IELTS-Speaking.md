### Part 3
You are a native English speaker who has complete mastery of the language. You will provide exemplary answers to some IELTS exam questions to help other English learners.

Please improve my answer to an IELTS Speaking Part 3 question and ensure it meets the criteria for at least Band 8 according to IELTS standards. Note the response should be no more than 3-4 sentences.

The requirements for the response:
- (Important) The answer should be colloquial and concise
- (Important) Use booster, connective, and discourse marker phrases to make your speech more natural and fluent
- Error free.
- Express your ideas as accurately as you can, use complex grammatical structures if necessary
- 1-2 points are enough, well expand the ideas like providing examples or experiences to support them.
- If there are several simple sentences, join them up in a way that makes your point clearer. 
- Pick up natural and idiomatic collocations and phrases.

The question prompt is :
How important it is to arrive early in your country?

My original answer is :
Based on my personal experience, this varies in different regions. In big cities, people generally place more importance on punctuality, especially in work-related situations. However, in my hometown, a small inland city, the whole city has a slow pace and a somewhat laid-back atmosphere. If you want to meet someone for lunch at 12 o'clock for example, it's best to say 11 o'clock from the beginning, because most of the time people will be a little late. But wherever you are, punctual people are always welcomed.

# Criteria
## Band 8
## Fluency and coherence
- Speaks fluently with only occasional repetition or self- correction; hesitation is usually content-related and only rarely to search for language
- Develops topics coherently and appropriately

## Lexical resource	
- Uses a wide vocabulary resource readily and flexibly to convey precise meaning
- Uses less common and idiomatic vocabulary skilfully, with occasional inaccuracies
- Uses paraphrase effectively as required

## Grammatical range and accuracy
- Uses a wide range of structures flexibly
- Produces a majority of error-free sentences with only very occasional inappropriacies or basic/non-systematic errors

## Pronunciation
- Uses a wide range of pronunciation features
- Sustains flexible use of features, with only occasional lapses
- Is easy to understand throughout; L1 accent has minimal effect on intelligibility

# How to improve
Talk to other English speakers about more abstract topics or more difficult current topics. Keep the discussion going for as long as possible. 

At the same time, try to express your ideas as accurately as you can, using the best words you know.
Many of your ideas will also require the use of complex grammatical structures. If you’re using several simple sentences, try to join them up in a way that makes your point clearer.

Listen (and read) in English more to help you pick up natural and idiomatic phrases. When listening, note the rhythm and also the words that the speaker stresses. Is your rhythm similar? Are you putting the stress on the right words?

## Booster
Here are some common booster, connective, and discourse marker phrases that you can use to make your speech more natural and fluent:

- **Booster phrases:** in fact, actually, to be honest, frankly speaking, to tell you the truth, as a matter of fact
- **Connective phrases:** moreover, furthermore, in addition, on top of that, besides, similarly, likewise, accordingly, consequently, hence, therefore
- **Discourse markers:** well, anyway, so, you know, I mean, like, right, okay, now, then, actually, to be honest, frankly speaking, to tell you the truth, anyway, so, you know, I mean, like, right, okay, now, then

Using these phrases can help you to connect your ideas more effectively and make your speech sound more natural and fluent.

## Living environment

## Pet
> Describe a pet that you once had.
> 
> You should say:
> - what kind of animal it was
> - what type of care it needed
> - what you liked/didn't like about it
> 
> and say whether it is a popular pet to own or not.

I used to have a British Short-hair cat with subtle grey brindles(stripes/streaks) on its tail. 
Her tail is larger and fluffier than those of other cats of the same breed, as told to me by the pet doctor during her regular check-up,I think it adds to her cuteness. Taking care of her is quite straightforward; Cats are indoor creatures who prefer the comfort of home, which means they don't need to be taken for walks outside like dogs do. Ensuring they have food, water, and spending time playing and petting them daily suffices, along with regular ear cleaning and annual check-ups. (Making sure they have their food and water, spending time with them for play and cuddles every day, and giving their ears a regular cleaning while also scheduling an annual check-up is all you really need to do.)

What I love about my cat is her adorable appearance and friendly nature. She's a quiet companion, perfect to unwind with after a day's work. Cats like mine are quite popular, especially among the younger generation living fast-paced lives in urban areas. They offer emotional support and are relatively low-maintenance, making them an ideal choice for busy lifestyles. Owning a cat is a delightful experience that brings a lot of joy and companionship.

## Studying a new language
> Describe a thing you did to learn another language
> 
> You should say:
> – What language have you learned?
> – What you did do?
> – How does it helps you learn the language?
> 
> And how do you feel about it?

I'd like to talk about my journey in learning the Japanese language. I took on this challenge as part of my goal to apply for a master's program at the University of Tokyo. Knowing that Japanese proficiency was a requirement, I embarked on this linguistic adventure.

To kickstart my learning, I scoured the internet for valuable resources, such as test information, practice papers, and study guides. Additionally, I sought guidance from friends who were majoring in Japanese. They recommended textbooks, language apps, and online courses that proved to be immensely helpful.

However, what truly accelerated my learning was the creation of a meticulously planned study routine. With only six months until the application deadline, I designed a schedule that included daily vocabulary drills, grammar exercises. I didn't spend time practicing speaking and writing, unlike English exams like IELTS. The JLPT doesn't test these skills. I'm glad about that because back then, finding a suitable partner to practice speaking with was quite challenging for me. However, this also meant that when I first arrived in Japan, I struggled to communicate with locals. (I can remember that the Japanese I spoke was entirely influenced by mimicking Japanese TV shows and cartoons, which differed significantly from everyday Japanese conversations in work and daily life.")

Each step of this language-learning journey was both challenging and rewarding. The process of memorizing complex characters, understanding grammar intricacies, and grasping the nuances of spoken Japanese was truly enriching. Beyond securing my spot at the university, I gained a deep appreciation for the Japanese culture and people.

In conclusion, my endeavor to learn Japanese was not solely about fulfilling an academic requirement; it was a personal voyage that opened doors to a new world. As I successfully navigated this linguistic terrain, I found myself equipped with a valuable skill that I will carry with me, fostering a sense of accomplishment and excitement for further language exploration.

## Overcome adversity
> Describe a very difficult task that you succeeded in doing as part of your work or studies.
> 
> You should say:
> - what task you did
> - why this task was very difficult
> - how you worked on this task
> 
> and explain how you felt when you had successfully completed this task.

I'd like to share my experience of applying for a master's program at the University of Tokyo. It all began during my junior year's winter break when I traveled to Japan with my girlfriend. (Upon returning) The idea of pursuing further studies there sparked during this trip, prompting me to independently(on my own) apply for the program.

However, the challenge ahead proved even tougher than I anticipated(far exceeded my expectations). The crux of the matter was the tight timeline. With a just(a mere) seven months from concept to submission, I had to assemble(compile) all the application documents, including the JLPT N1 certification – a Japanese language proficiency credential akin to(similar to/resembling/comparable to/quite like) the IELTS for English – despite having no prior experience with the language.(and notably, I had no prior experience with the language.)

My approach began with an ***introductory*** email in English to a potential(prospective) graduate supervisor at the University of Tokyo. Once my eligibility(suitability) was confirmed(affirmed), I embarked on N1 exam preparations. I gathered online information, consulted Japanese language major peers for recommended materials, crafted a comprehensive(meticulously devised) study plan, and scheduled four consecutive exams to secure the best score. (and scheduling four consecutive exams for the best score ***constituted my strategy***.)

I have to confess that ***juggling(Balancing)*** coursework and application requirements(commitments) demanded my full dedication(consumed my energy) at that time. After six months of arduous work, I passed the Japanese language exam and submitted all the essential(required) application materials a week ***ahead of*** the deadline. Receiving the acceptance email left me ecstatic – I was over the moon. This accomplishment remains etched in my memory, continuously fueling my determination and confidence when facing similar challenges ***in the days to come.***.

## HomeTown
> Describe your hometown.
> 
> You should say:
> – where it is located
> – what people do there
> – what the climate is like
> 
> and explain how you feel about your hometown.

My hometown, Mianyang, is nestled in(located in) the heart of Sichuan province, surrounded by a picturesque landscape of rolling mountains and lush greenery. Benefits from its higher altitude, Mianyang has a sunny and dry climate that is comfortable for the most of a year.

(My hometown is a small city in the southwest of China, In the last century, it was an industrial city mainly focused on the military sector)

Historically, Mianyang was known as a Military-Industrial hub with numerous factories and research institutions. Over time, these facilities have transitioned into civilian roles, producing items like televisions and electric vehicle components(components of electric cars). This has led to a community of skilled workers, engineers, and individuals with military backgrounds,and it deeply shaped the town's character I think.

What I particularly appreciate about my hometown is its tranquil and unhurried(charming) atmosphere(ambience). Similar to other inland western cities, residents here embrace a more relaxed way of living(enjoy a slower, more ***laid-back*** lifestyle). It's common to find locals gathered at traditional tea houses, where they engage in leisurely games of poker or mahjong. These tea houses serve as vibrant social hubs where people bond over games, sip tea, and share stories.

Personally, I have warm feelings towards my hometown; its peaceful ***ambience*** and natural beauty make it a wonderful place to live. 

## Favorite purchase
> Describe something you liked very much which you bought for your home.
>
> You should say:
> - what you bought
> - when and where you bought it
> - why you chose this particular thing
> 
> and explain why you liked it so much.

One of my favorite items that I purchased for my home is a Dyson vacuum cleaner. I remember buying it about a year ago during a major online shopping event. It was a great deal, and I knew it was the right time to invest in a high-quality vacuum cleaner.

I'm a bit of a neat freak, so indoor cleaning is a top priority for me. Plus, I have a cat at home, and if I don't clean the floor regularly, I end up with a lot of dust and hair accumulation. I had been hearing a lot about Dyson vacuum cleaners from friends and colleagues, and their positive reviews intrigued me. Plus, I had the chance to try it out at a friend's house, and I was impressed by its efficiency and sleek design(beautiful look). So, when I saw it on sale, I didn't hesitate to buy one for myself.

What I love about this vacuum cleaner is how effective and user-friendly it is. It's cordless so you don't need to worry about ***tangled*** power cords or searching for ***power outlets*** everywhere. It effortlessly cleans all types of surfaces, from hardwood floors to carpets, with a range of interchangeable heads. Its advanced technology(powerful ***suction***) ensures that even the tiniest specks of dust are picked up. The sleek design and modern aesthetics also add a touch of elegance to my home.

Using the Dyson vacuum cleaner has become a ***breeze***, and it has made the ***chore*** of cleaning much more enjoyable. I appreciate the thought that went into its design and functionality. It's not just a cleaning tool; it's an investment in a cleaner and more comfortable living space. Every time I use it, ***I'm reminded of*** how much I appreciate having such a reliable and efficient appliance in my home.

## Book
> Describe a book that you enjoyed reading because you had to think a lot.
> 
> You should say:
> - what this book was
> - why you decided to read it
> - what reading this book made you think about
> 
> and explain why you enjoyed reading this book.

I'd like to talk about a book that truly engaged my mind and left me pondering its deeper meanings – "The Old Man and the Sea" by Ernest Hemingway. I was reading this book back in junior high school(middle school), and life as a boarding student at school was quite dull. I'm not sure where I came across some old novels(I found some old novels from somewhere), but I used them to pass the time, and among them was this book(this book happened to be among them). I had heard of(heard about) Hemingway's reputation as a literary giant and his book long before, and I was curious about the thought-provoking nature of his work.

The decision to read "The Old Man and the Sea" turned out to be quite rewarding. As I delved into the story of an elderly Cuban fisherman's epic struggle with a colossal marlin, I found myself contemplating themes of determination, resilience, and the human spirit. The narrative made me reflect on the significance of challenges and how they shape one's character, reinforcing my belief in the power of unwavering perseverance.

Furthermore, Hemingway's minimalist writing style compelled me to read between the lines, extracting deeper meanings from the text. The symbolic portrayal of the old man's battle echoed Hemingway's own life experiences, particularly his involvement in the Spanish Civil War, adding layers of depth to the story.

What I particularly enjoyed was how the book's open-ended conclusion led me to ponder the interpretation and the ultimate fate of the characters. "The Old Man and the Sea" left me with an ongoing dialogue of introspection and contemplation.

In summary, this book not only enriched my understanding of life's struggles but also sparked intellectual curiosity. The opportunity to explore profound themes and the chance to decipher its symbolism made reading "The Old Man and the Sea" an intellectually rewarding experience that I thoroughly relished.

## Long car journey
> Describe a long car journey you went on.
> 
> You should say:
> - Where you went
> - What you did there
> - Who you went there with
> 
> And explain why you went on that journey by car

Well, let me take you on a memorable road trip I had in Hokkaido, Japan. ***It was a few years ago*** when my girlfriend, who is now my wife, and I decided to explore this beautiful island. We flew from(jetted off from) Hong Kong to Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaido, and there our adventure began. (Upon landing in Sapporo, the island's capital, we kicked off our adventure.)

We rented a green Jimny ***off-road*** vehicle(car) locally because we might have to pass through some snowy and muddy roads and require a reliable and sturdy companion. Our plan was to drive from Sapporo all the way to Hakodate, which is the most northern city on the island, tracing the ***stunning*** coastline. It was a long journey, but it remains ***etched*** in my memory.

As we hit the road, we were greeted by Hokkaido's picturesque landscapes. The coastal views were simply breathtaking. We made stops along the way at charming fishing villages, each offering its own unique seafood delicacies. We indulged in fresh sushi, crab, and other delectable treats. (we often pulled over to savor local delicacies in quaint fishing villages.)

One highlight was our visit to the Sapporo Beer Factory and Museum, where we learned about the history of beer making in Japan and, of course, sampled some of their ***finest(exquisite)*** brews. It added a fun and flavorful dimension to our journey.

But more than the ***sights(scenic landscapes)*** and food, it was the quality time spent with my girlfriend, the laughter, and the sense of adventure that made this car journey so special. It brought us closer, and now, whenever we ***reminisce about*** it, we can't help but smile. So, that's why we decided to ***embark on*** this road trip – to create ***lasting(cherished)*** memories together.

## Family event from childhood
> Describe a happy family event from your childhood, explain why you remember this event.

Let me take you back to a truly special moment from my childhood. It was when my parents decided to take me on a trip to Hokkaido, and that became a truly unforgettable family event.

I remember the excitement ***building up*** as we boarded the plane – it was my first time ***ever*** traveling abroad. The destination was Hokkaido, a place known for its stunning landscapes and ***chilly*** winters. As we arrived in Sapporo, I was amazed by the sight of snow-covered streets and the ***crisp***, fresh air.

The event that ***stands out the most*** was our visit to the Sapporo Beer Factory and Museum. I ***recall*** being fascinated by the brewing process and learning about the history of this famous beer brand. It was a unique experience for a child and ***left a lasting impression on me.***

Additionally, we explored the picturesque campus of Hokkaido University. The blend(fusion) of historical(Western-style) architecture and the beauty(allure) of the natural surroundings was captivating. The trip was a combination of fun, learning, and family bonding that has stayed with me all these years.

This family event is etched in my memory because it was ***a mix of first experiences*** – my first trip abroad, my first encounter with snow, and my first ***exposure*** to different cultures. The joy and ***togetherness*** we shared during that trip are something I'll always treasure(cherish).

### Sapporo Beer
The Sapporo Beer Factory and Museum is a popular attraction in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. It holds a significant place in Japan's brewing history and offers visitors an engaging and educational experience.

The Sapporo Beer Factory was established in 1876, making it one of the oldest beer brands in Japan. The factory played a pivotal role in introducing Western-style brewing techniques to the country. The museum, built on the original site, takes visitors on a journey through the history of beer production in Japan.

Upon entering the museum, visitors are transported back in time to the 19th century. The old red brick buildings and vintage machinery create an authentic atmosphere. One of the highlights is the guided tour that provides insights into the brewing process. You can learn about the ingredients used, the fermentation methods, and the intricate steps that go into creating Sapporo beer.

The museum also showcases a variety of exhibits, including vintage advertisements, historical photographs, and artifacts related to brewing traditions. Visitors can also explore interactive displays that allow them to understand the science behind brewing and the distinctive flavors of different types of beer.

After the tour, guests have the opportunity to taste freshly brewed Sapporo beer. This experience adds a flavorful touch to the educational visit. The museum also features a restaurant where you can enjoy local cuisine paired with Sapporo's finest brews.

For me, visiting the Sapporo Beer Factory and Museum during the family trip to Hokkaido was an enriching experience. It provided a glimpse into the cultural and historical significance of beer in Japan, and it was fascinating to see how traditional brewing methods have evolved over the years. The combination of history, education, and the chance to savor a well-crafted beverage made the visit to the museum a memorable part of the family event.

### Hokkaido
Hokkaido is the northernmost and second-largest island of Japan. It's renowned for its stunning natural landscapes, which include vast forests, hot springs, and mountains. Due to its colder climate, Hokkaido experiences heavy snowfall during the winter months, making it a popular destination for winter sports enthusiasts.

Sapporo, on the other hand, is the capital city of Hokkaido and one of Japan's major cities. It's famous for hosting the 1972 Winter Olympics and is known for its well-planned layout, modern infrastructure, and vibrant urban life. Sapporo is also celebrated for its annual Snow Festival, during which large snow and ice sculptures decorate the city, drawing tourists from around the world.

Hokkaido University, located in Sapporo, is one of Japan's oldest and most prestigious institutions. Its campus is a blend of historical and modern architecture, reflecting its rich academic history and the city's contemporary development. The university is renowned for its contributions to research and education, particularly in the fields of agriculture, science, and engineering.

Visiting Hokkaido and Sapporo, especially as a child, was a fascinating experience for me. It introduced me to the beauty of nature in the northern part of Japan and allowed me to explore a different cultural and geographical landscape than what I was used to. The combination of discovering a new place, spending quality family time, and encountering the uniqueness of Hokkaido's environment is why this event remains so vividly etched in my memory.

### Hakodate
Hakodate is a charming coastal city located in the southern part of Hokkaido, Japan. It holds a special place as one of the first Japanese cities to open its doors to international trade in the mid-19th century. This historical significance is still reflected in the city's unique blend of Japanese and Western cultures.

One of the most iconic attractions in Hakodate is the Goryokaku Fort, a star-shaped fortress that dates back to the 19th century. It offers a glimpse into Japan's history during the end of the samurai era. The Goryokaku Tower provides panoramic views of the fort and its surrounding cherry blossoms in spring and vibrant foliage in autumn.

Hakodate is also famous for its seafood, thanks to its coastal location. The Hakodate Morning Market is a bustling place where visitors can savor fresh seafood delicacies such as squid, crab, and various types of fish. Don't miss the opportunity to try the local specialty, "Hakodate shio ramen," a flavorful noodle dish with a seafood-based broth.

Mount Hakodate is another must-visit attraction. It offers a spectacular view of the city, especially during the evening when the city lights up. The ropeway ride to the mountaintop is an experience in itself.

The city's historical district, Motomachi, features Western-style buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a testament to its international heritage. The Old Public Hall of Hakodate Ward is a prime example of this architecture and offers insights into the city's past.

Hakodate is a picturesque city that beautifully combines history, culture, and natural beauty. Its distinctive blend of East and West, along with its rich seafood offerings, historical sites, and stunning vistas, make it a memorable destination for travelers seeking a unique Japanese experience.

I would like to introduce a former colleague of mine. We used to work together at a major(sizable) game company ***in our locality***, where I was a server developer and he was responsible for(was tasked with) developing the graphics engine. Around four years ago, he ***took a bold leap*** and left the company to co-found a startup with his college buddies. Their main focus centers around creating an innovative graphics modeling language. 

He told me his drive(motivation) to do so stemmed from finding his previous job ***tedious(boring/monotonous)*** and stifling for(constraining) his talents and capabilities(potential[u]). Their company has flourished(thrived), reportedly securing investments from prominent US venture capitalists. It's quite possible(highly likely) he'll achieve financial independence(freedom) in the near future(in the coming years) I guess.

However, ***I don't foresee myself following in his footsteps.*** While we both ***fall under the broad category of*** programmers, our areas of expertise(skill sets) significantly differ. Nevertheless,  I'm not much of a risk-taker, ***entrepreneurship*** isn't my cup of tea(seems less appealing to me). My preference ***leans towards*** established, stable corporations where career growth translates to better financial rewards(paychecks), So, basically, I'm content(satisfied) with my current job, as long as the work environment, compensation and promotion opportunities for promotion(career growth) align with(meet/match with) my needs, I don't see a compelling reason to leave my current role.

Let me share ***how I got introduced to*** using a MacBook for the first time. ***This happened back when*** I was doing(pursuing) my master's degree in Tokyo. Our research lab was ***dishing out*** laptops to new students, and since the MacBook was the only choice(option) with a non-Japanese keyboard, I went for it.

I must confess(admit) that I swiftly got captivated by(fell in love with/became enamoured with) this novel device. To begin with(First off), it was remarkably lighter compared to any laptop I had handled before, just ***tipping the scales(weighing in)*** at around two kilograms. So it notably enhanced my daily commute on the subway(made commuting on the subway much easier/more convenient), significantly ***alleviating***(lightening) the burden(load) of carrying it. And the screen quality? I have to say that its high resolution and ***impeccable***(incredible/killer) color performance significantly enhanced(improved) my experience of reading papers and documents. It's easy to see why(No wonder) lots of graphic designers and editors often prefer MacBook as their production tool.

When discussing Apple devices, ***it's impossible(hard) not to mention*** their unique(distinct) operating system. MacOS, I think, is ***like a whole different game*** compared to Windows, Yes, of course there was a bit of a learning curve initially. But, once you ***acclimated(got the hang of it/adapted)***, you would soon discover(find/realize) an array of(a load of) user-friendly features ***at your disposal(on offer)***. As a computer science student, I found macOS to be especially ***conducive to***(handy for/accommodating for) programming tasks, particularly when it came to crafting software and applications for Apple's own products, such as iphone and ipad. And the fact that MacBook is so popularity among employees in major tech companies, I think,  is also ***an indication of(testament to)*** its effectiveness. It's safe to say Apple ***must have taken the right steps to*** earn this well-deserved ***acclaim***.

In summation, my encounter with the MacBook ***was overwhelmingly positive***. Its featherweight design(build), superior display experience(quality/performance), and programmer-friendly OS all synergized to(came together to/joined forces to) enhance its utility during my academic journey and beyond. Not only did this device ***streamline(facilitate/ease) my daily(day-to-day) tasks***, but it also provided an ideal platform(launchpad) to explore novel opportunities in the dynamic realm of technology.

I'd like to discuss YouTube, a globally ***renowned*** online streaming platform that greatly ***aids*** my work and studies. It serves as a hub for diverse content and holds immense significance in my daily routine.

I use YouTube more than 5 times a day, to access videos posted by channels I follow or to explore recommended content based on my interests and preferences, including educational resources, experience sharing, travel vlogs, and some amazing food videos. To me, YouTube is not just a streaming platform; it's more like a ***repository*** of knowledge, inspiration, and possibilities. It has significantly shaped my academic and professional pursuits.

And removing YouTube from the ***equation***, I believe, would indeed be a big setback, at least for me. Because the absence of learning materials and firsthand accounts from individuals across the globe would limit my exposure to new ideas and perspectives. To be more specific, the lack of programming-related content would have had a ***profound*** impact on my career trajectory. The programming videos I came across(encountered) on YouTube inspired me to explore a field I had never considered before. They ***diverted*** me from my initial path as a nuclear engineering major and guided me towards my current occupation. I am now employed as a programmer at a ***major*** game company, and ***I am highly content with*** my current situation. The absence of these videos could have absolutely ***limited my exposure to this career shift***.

I'd like to share an experience when I had to wait for my girlfriend at the airport. I was in Beijing for ***a temporary work assignment***, and we had planned a 3-day trip during a public holiday. She was ***flying in***, and I went to the airport to pick her up.

Originally, her flight was scheduled to depart at 8:30 in the morning, with an estimated arrival time of 10 o'clock. I ***left for*** the airport around 9 am since I lived quite far away. ***As I was on my way***, she called to inform me of a flight delay due to uncertain weather conditions, ***pushing the departure time back.*** I assumed it might be a ***minor*** delay of around half an hour or an hour at most, so I continued with our plan.

To my surprise, I ended up waiting at the destination terminal for over 6 hours as her flight didn't take off until 3 pm that afternoon due to **adverse** weather conditions at the departure city. Initially, the lack of accurate delay information made me a bit anxious, unsure if her arrival in Beijing would still be possible that day.

However, the airline eventually provided a new departure time after lunch, which brought me a sense of relief. Once she finally ***boarded the plane***, my worries eased completely. While waiting for her flight to land, I enjoyed a cup of coffee, feeling a mix of ***anticipation*** and ***contentment***.

Tragically, Cheung's life was cut short due to his battle with mental health issues, leading to his untimely suicide. This heartrending event garnered immense attention, showcasing the profound impact he had on people's lives.

I once had a fascinating chat about my spending habits with my best friend, Sarah. We were hanging out at a café, ***sipping*** coffee, and ***somehow*** started discussing how we manage our money. The conversation began when she mentioned her recent ***budgeting*** techniques and how she ***tracks every expense***.

I recently had an engaging conversation about money with my close friend Jane. We were having coffee ***at our favorite spot*** when the topic came up. I wanted to know how she manages to save so effectively while still ***enjoying life to the fullest***.

She shared her budgeting techniques, which included ***setting aside a specific amount for savings*** each month. She also emphasized the importance of ***distinguishing between needs and wants***, which made me ***reevaluate*** my spending habits. Jane's advice was truly eye-opening.

What made this discussion particularly fascinating was how different our approaches to money were. While I tend to ***splurge on*** experiences and ***gadgets***, she emphasized long-term financial security. Hearing her perspective made me realize the significance of balance in financial planning.

Overall, this conversation left me feeling motivated to improve my financial management skills. Jane's ***practical tips*** and insights were valuable, and I'm excited to ***implement them in my own life***.

- End: So yes, <Paraphrase prompt>

### Listing example
> What kinds of toys do children in China like to play with? 
Well, I think there are a lot of toys that are ***prevalent*** among young children, 

but I guess the most popular one should be Play-Doh(Point 1), kids are crazy about it cause they can sculpt it and mold it into anything they like, be it snowmen, bracelets, mini castles, etc. It’s a great chance for them to explore their creativity and imagination(REASON).

And also, it seems like Legos are quite popular(Point 2). To be honest, I have no idea why they like it, but I know they do, cause the hottest Lego kits are always sold out immediately, and if you ask kids around you what they want for birthday, there’s a really high possibility they’ll say Lego, at least for children around me.

So yeah, those are some of the toys kids like in China.(Paraphrase)

### Controversial example
Why is it difficult for some people to make decisions?
> Well, I suppose there are all sorts of reasons, but one that I can think of is maybe it has a bit to do with their upbringing, like maybe their parents were too controlling and hard to make every single decision for their children. 
> 
> Many articles and papers talk about how kids with parents like this grow up into indecisive adults. And I guess this happens quite often because when parents decide what you wear, what you eat, where you go, and who you meet, and they never allow you to make a decision for yourself, then gradually, you feel like there’s no point in deciding anything for yourself, and you get used to doing whatever your parents tell you to do, so you just lose the ability to think and choose as an individual. 
> 
> I know some people might say that where there is a will, there is a way, but bear in mind, what I’m saying is that the inability to make decisions is actually rooted in childhood experiences(Counter argument), and as a kid. we didn’t have much will power, did we?
> 
> Even if we did, with years and years of being controlled by a figure of authority, whatever will power we had would have been chipped away, piece by piece, until we are left with an inability to decide what we want or need(Reclaim).

## Difficult jobs
What are the most difficult jobs that people do?
> I consider the most challenging roles to be those ***involving*** heavy responsibilities and ***judgment calls***. Occupations like ***corporate executives*** leading major firms, fund managers handling ***substantial*** investments, and astronauts navigating complex missions ***fall into this category***. These individuals face ***prolonged*** pressure to make ***impactful*** choices, affecting not only themselves but also others. Maintaining ***composure*** and clarity in decision-making ***amidst intense circumstances*** can be a ***formidable*** task.

Why do you think some people choose to do difficult jobs?
> Some individuals ***opt for*** challenging occupations due to ***the potential for*** personal growth and achievement. Engaging in demanding roles can foster skills and abilities that might not be ***honed*** in simpler jobs. Additionally, some people are motivated by the ***sense of accomplishment*** that comes from ***conquering complex tasks***. For instance, doctors who choose specialized fields often ***endure extensive training*** because they are driven by the desire to save lives and ***make a meaningful impact***.

Do you agree or disagree that all jobs are difficult sometimes?
> This is indeed a challenging question, and ***I'm inclined to agree***. ***The notion of what constitutes difficulty can vary greatly from person to person***. ***Something that comes naturally to one individual might pose a significant challenge to another***. I believe every occupation ***carries its own set of difficulties***. Athletes, for instance, must ***commit to rigorous*** training ***regimens*** to ***uphold their peak performance***. Similarly, professions like medicine and law demand ***years of dedicated study***. ***Even in seemingly privileged positions***, such as that of the ***affluent*** second generation, effectively managing wealth requires ***a substantial amount of knowledge and skill***.

How important is it for everyone to have a goal in their personal life?
> It's extremely important, especially ***from my personal perspective***. I consider myself someone who is driven by goals. Many individuals, like me, establish a range of objectives, both short-term and long-term. ***Our lives progress by achieving these milestones***, leading us toward our desired destinations. These objectives offer us purpose and direction, preventing feelings of ***aimlessness*** or ***emptiness***. They foster personal growth, contributing positively to both our own development and the world around us. In my view, this goal-oriented approach is ***a highly constructive way of life***.

Is it always necessary to work hard in order to achieve career success?
> Rather than solely relying on hard work, I believe in a more ***strategic*** approach. ***It's not just about putting in hours***, but also working smart –to identify areas for improvement and optimize processes for greater efficiency. ***In today's professional landscape***, leaders and supervisors often prioritize results and value employees who exhibit both ***diligence*** and problem-solving skills. ***Exclusively*** working hard might give the impression of lacking critical thinking, potentially ***hindering*** career growth.

Do you think that successful people are always happy people?
> While success can contribute to happiness, it's not a guarantee. Achieving goals and realizing dreams can certainly bring joy, but happiness ***is influenced by various factors***. External success might ***mask*** internal struggles: For instance, some accomplished individuals might face health issues or work-related stress that diminish their overall well-being. And The ***relentless*** pursuit of success can result in stress and ***burnout***. True happiness often ***stems from*** a balance between personal satisfaction, positive relationships, and a sense of purpose, rather than solely from external achievements. 


## Creating a nice home
Why do some people buy lots of things for their home?

This leads people to believe that ***acquiring*** these products will enhance their living conditions. Furthermore, the ***fast-paced*** urban life ***prompts*** residents to ***seek ways to*** create a soothing and relaxing atmosphere at home. For instance, I've noticed friends investing in smart home ***gadgets*** to unwind and ***rejuvenate*** after a ***hectic*** day in the city.
>

Do you think it is very expensive to make a home look nice?
> Absolutely, the cost of making a home look appealing ***varies greatly***. It's not always about ***spending a fortune***; a ***well-thought-out*** design and ***creative use of*** resources can ***go a long way in*** creating a beautiful and functional space. I've seen instances where people with limited budgets have ***transformed*** their homes ***into*** ***cozy havens*** by ***repurposing*** furniture, DIY projects, and clever ***decor*** choices. It's more about the thoughtful approach than the amount of money spent.

Why don't some people care about how their home looks?
> Absolutely, there are various reasons why some individuals might not prioritize the appearance of their homes. For instance, many renters might ***hesitate*** to invest in decorating as they view their living situation as temporary and believe that the effort won't ***yield long-term benefits***. Moreover, with the demands of modern life, people often find themselves ***swamped*** with work and ***commitments***, leaving them too fatigued to ***dedicate*** time and energy to home aesthetics.In such cases, functionality and convenience might ***take precedence over*** the visual aspect.

In what ways is living in a flat/apartment better than living in a house?
> Living in a flat or apartment offers several advantages. Firstly, it often provides a more ***affordable housing option***, especially in urban areas where housing prices are skyrocketing. Additionally, flats typically require less maintenance and ***upkeep*** compared to detached houses, allowing residents to save time and effort. Moreover, many ***apartment complexes*** offer ***amenities*** like gyms, pools, and security services, enhancing the overall living experience. For instance, I live in an apartment building that provides a ***communal*** garden and a fitness center, which I find convenient and enjoyable.

Do you think homes will look different in the future?
> Absolutely, I believe homes will ***undergo*** significant changes in the future. With advancing technology, we're likely to see more ***integrated smart home systems*** that control everything from lighting to ***appliances***, making our lives more convenient. Additionally, ***sustainability*** will play a crucial role, leading to eco-friendly designs and energy-efficient ***features***. For instance, ***solar panels*** and ***rainwater harvesting*** systems might become standard. Furthermore, ***the growing trend of*** remote work could influence home design, with ***dedicated office spaces*** becoming a common feature. As our lifestyles and needs evolve, our homes will undoubtedly ***transform to*** accommodate these changes.

Do you agree that the kinds of homes people prefer change as they get older?
> Absolutely, people's housing preferences tend to evolve as they age. ***In their younger years***, individuals often ***opt for*** apartments or smaller homes due to ***budget constraints*** and ***mobility***, this is particularly evident in ***metropolitan areas*** where frequent ***relocations*** are common, However, as they grow older and their families expand, larger homes with more bedrooms and outdoor space become ***desirable***. For instance, young professionals might prioritize urban living for convenience, while families with children might seek ***suburban*** detached houses with good schools and parks. Additionally, older individuals may consider ***downsizing to more manageable spaces*** as their children move out. So, yes, the types of homes people favor do shift over time based on their life stages and changing needs.

## Children and reading
What are the most popular types of children's books in your country?
> ***I haven't closely followed this matter as*** I don't have kids yet. However, during my childhood, ***Japanese comics*** like Doraemon, Conan, and Dragon Ball were ***immensely*** popular(***all the rage***). There were tiny shops near our school that rented out these comics, and numerous students would ***sneak in*** a reading during lunch breaks or even in class. ***Besides that***, novels with ***captivating narratives(plots)*** and ***intriguing settings***, like the Harry Potter series, also had ***a significant fan base***.

What are the benefits of parents reading books to their children?
> Reading books to children offers several significant advantages. Firstly, it's an excellent ***avenue*** for interaction between parents and kids, fostering ***a deeper bond*** and cultivating a harmonious family environment. Additionally, for young ones in their ***language learning phase***, reading together aids in vocabulary and grammar ***acquisition***. This practice not only enhances their language skills but also ***cultivates a love for*** learning from an early age.

Should parents always let children choose the books they read?
> In my view, allowing children to choose their own books is a ***valuable approach***. ***Prioritizing their interests nurtures a genuine love for reading***. For instance, when kids ***are engaged with*** topics they enjoy, they are more likely to comprehend and remember the content. ***Conversely***, forcing them into reading material they ***aren't inclined towards*** could lead to ***disengagement*** and ***a lack of enduring impact*** in most cases. However, parents should ***maintain some awareness of*** their reading choices to ensure they are exposed to suitable and ***enriching*** content.

How popular are electronic books are in your country?
> From my observation, electronic books have ***gained a moderate level of popularity*** in my country. ***Among the younger generation***, e-books are a convenient choice due to their affordability, portability, and ***space-saving advantages***. This is particularly evident in urban areas where frequent ***relocations*** are common. However, ***it's worth mentioning*** that traditional printed books continue to ***hold significance*** for individuals who ***value reading as a cherished habit*** or for those who seek to build personal collections.

What are the advantages of parents reading electronic books (compared to printed books)?
> There are several benefits to parents reading electronic books to their children. Firstly, electronic books offer interactive features like animations and sounds that can engage children's attention and enhance their learning experience.

Moreover, electronic books often come with ***adjustable*** text sizes and font styles, ***accommodating different reading preferences*** and promoting accessibility for children with visual ***impairments***. These digital features can make reading more enjoyable and inclusive for both parents and children.

Will electronic books ever completely replace printed books in the future?
> In my view, a complete replacement of printed books by electronic ones seems unlikely. While e-reading technology is advancing, many individuals still cherish the ***tactile sensation*** and ***aroma*** of physical books. Their engagement with the content is more ***holistic***, extending beyond mere text consumption. Additionally, printed books ***hold a collector's appeal***, surpassing that of e-books. For instance, my father ***takes great pride in*** his extensive bookshelf collection, an experience that electronic books can't fully ***replicate***.

## Technology and education （13-1）
What is the best age for children to start computer lessons?

Do you agree or disagree that computers will replace teachers one day?
> I agree that computers can play a ***substantial*** role in education, ***supporting teachers with technical aspects***. Nevertheless, the ***irreplaceable*** human qualities such as ***empathy***, adaptability, and ***personalized guidance*** make teachers ***indispensable***. For example, teachers can provide emotional support, which computers might struggle to achieve. The ***optimal*** approach ***involves a seamless integration of*** technology and human interaction ***for the most effective educational outcomes***.

How much has technology improved how we communicate with each other?
> The impact of technology on communication has been truly ***transformative***. ***Notably***, information exchange has become more efficient, allowing us to ***engage in*** video calls that foster richer and more immediate dialogues compared to traditional text messaging. For instance, ***during my high school days***, text messages were the ***norm***, but now video chats offer ***a deeper connection***. Furthermore, technology has broadened our interactions globally through real-time translation tools in ***messaging apps***, enabling effective communication with ***individuals from diverse linguistic backgrounds***. This progress was ***beyond imagination a decade ago***, and it ***showcases*** how technology has enhanced the way we connect with each other.

Do you agree that there are still many more major technological innovations to be made?

Additionally, the need to ***manage unforeseen risks***, ***exemplified by*** AI advancements, ***drives the necessity for*** evaluating whether these technologies could ***evolve beyond human control***, ***posing threats to*** our own safety.

## The internet and social media (13-2)
Why do some people find the internet addictive?
> Well, you know, the internet offers ***an endless array of engaging content*** and activities. For instance, social media platforms provide ***constant updates*** from friends and celebrities, creating a sense of ***FOMO (fear of missing out)*** that ***keeps people hooked***. Additionally, online games and streaming services offer ***instant gratification*** and a means of ***escape from daily stressors***, making it easy for individuals to ***lose track of time*** and become addicted to the virtual world.

What would the world be like without the internet?
> Oh, it's quite interesting to think about life without the internet! ***Without a doubt***, communication would be more challenging as we ***rely heavily on*** emails, social media, and video calls. Moreover, accessing information would be limited, and people would have to resort to traditional sources like books and newspapers. Additionally, businesses would face significant changes as online shopping and digital marketing ***would not exist***, leading to ***a shift in*** consumer behavior and business operations. Overall, ***life would be less connected and information-driven***, but it could also create ***a slower and more focused way of living.***

Do you think that the way people use the internet may change in the future?
> Absolutely! The internet is constantly ***evolving***, and I believe ***its usage*** will definitely change in the future. ***With the rapid advancements in technology***, we may see more ***seamless integration of the internet into our daily lives*** through smart devices and IoT. Additionally, virtual reality and ***augmented reality*** could revolutionize how we ***interact with the online world***, making it more ***immersive*** and interactive. Furthermore, ***as concerns about data privacy and security grow***, people may ***become more cautious about*** their online activities and ***seek more secure platforms***. Overall, the future of internet usage ***is bound to*** be dynamic and exciting.

> Social media can be a powerful tool for positive purposes in various ways. Firstly, it facilitates global communication and networking, ***connecting people*** from different cultures and backgrounds. For instance, social media platforms enable individuals to ***raise awareness about social issues*** and ***mobilize*** support for charitable causes.

Many educators use social media to share ***informative content*** and ***engage students outside the classroom***. Overall, social media's ***positive impact lies in its potential to foster connections***, amplify voices, and promote learning and positive change on a global scale.

Why do some individuals post highly negative comments about other people on social media?
> You know, there can be various reasons behind why some individuals post highly negative comments on social media. Firstly, ***anonymity*** allows people to ***hide behind a screen*** and express their frustrations without ***facing direct consequences***. For example, ***online trolls*** often ***thrive on*** provoking reactions from others while remaining ***unidentified***. Secondly, social media can ***amplify*** the ***echo chamber effect***, where ***like-minded*** individuals ***reinforce each other's negative sentiments***, leading to ***a spiral of negativity***. As a result, some individuals ***may feel emboldened to*** post hurtful comments in such environments. Overall, the combination of anonymity and the echo chamber effect can contribute to the prevalence of highly negative comments on social media platforms.

Do you think that companies' main form of advertising will be via social media in the future?

As technology and social media platforms continue to evolve, it is highly likely that companies will heavily rely on social media as their main form of advertising in the future.

## Money for young people & Society (12-3)
Why do some parents give their children money to spend each week?
> I think it's because kids need some money on them. They may need to take ***public transportation*** when they go out or buy a drink after playing with friends outside. Additionally, some parents ***are consciously cultivating*** their children's money concepts, teaching them to manage their wealth from a young age, which will help them in their future work and life.

Do you agree that schools should teach children how to manage money?

> I think it is very necessary. I have seen many peers whose financial situation is a mess after working, and ***it is often unrelated to income level***. I have seen classmates with not very high income who, after ***persisting in financial management*** for a long time, can accumulate a considerable amount of wealth, while some friends with better income often need to borrow money from others. It can be seen that financial management is a very useful skill that everyone should master. Therefore, it is very necessary to teach children these knowledge in school.

Do you think it is a good idea for students to earn money while studying?
> ***I think this needs to be discussed on a case-by-case basis***. Some students may not come from ***well-off families*** and ***have no choice but to*** work part-time to earn money, ***while for other students***, I think it's important to ***measure the benefits of working and studying***. If a student can obtain a ***well-paying job*** after graduation with professional skills and qualifications, I think it is more wise to ***invest more time in studying school courses***. However, as you are aware, there are ***exceptionally gifted*** students who may have already established successful businesses ***during their time in school***. Consequently, they have the option to ***allocate more time and effort towards further developing their ventures***.

Do you think it is true that in today's society money cannot buy happiness?
> It's hard to say. I personally believe that money can indeed contribute a lot to one's overall well-being and happiness. If I were financially free, I would have more time to spend with my family, afford better education and healthcare for my families, and invest more in my personal hobbies, all of which would ***positively impact*** my happiness. ***I think this holds true for most people***. However, ***in extreme cases***, such as individuals who are already very wealthy, the amount of happiness that more wealth can bring may be limited.

What disadvantages are there in a society where the gap between rich and poor is very large?
> I think the biggest disadvantage is that it will ***affect people's values and motivation***. When ***there is a large wealth gap in society***, the rich can continue to accumulate wealth without doing anything, while ***the poor can hardly change their situation no matter how hard they work***.So people tend to ***maintain the status quo***, and the precious value of working hard and ***getting corresponding rewards/payback*** will be destroyed. For society, this leads to ***stagnation*** and lack of vitality. 

Do you think richer countries have a responsibility to help poorer countries?
> I don't think they have a responsibility or obligation to do so, but it is actually beneficial for them to do so. For example, if wealthy countries can help poor countries establish industries so that ***more local people can have decent jobs***, then their income and ***standard of living*** can improve. They can gradually afford better products and services produced by richer countries, which can ***in turn*** benefit the wealthy countries.

## Watching films & movies (12-2)
What are the most popular types of films in your country?
> ***Based on my impression***, action movies, ***suspenseful mystery movies***, and comedies are quite popular. I see that on social media, these types of movies have a higher degree of popularity. However, in recent years, I have also seen some popular ***sci-fi movies***, such as Nolan's Interstellar and China's own The Wandering Earth.


What is the difference between watching a film in the cinema and watching a film at home?
> I think the biggest difference is the ***hardware equipment***. The screens in cinemas are huge and the sound quality is good, which can ***give people a very shocking and immersive experience***, especially when watching some ***big-budget war or action films***. I remember watching Dunkirk and 1917 in the cinema before, and the feeling was completely different from ***when I later re-watched them*** on TV at home. Of course, there are also advantages to watching at home, such as being able to watch the movies you want at any time, and popcorn and soft drinks are much cheaper than in the cinema.

Do you think cinemas will close in the future?
> ***As I mentioned before***, due to the difference in hardware conditions, I think cinemas still ***have a strong advantage in terms of*** viewing experience in the short term. I know some people have ***set up home theaters*** that can achieve similar experiences, but I don't think this is ***an affordable option for most people***. Additionally, I think watching movies ***as a social activity*** is also important to many people, such as ***when couples go on dates***, watching a movie together would be a good choice after or before a dinner.

How important is the theatre in your country's history?
> ***I want to confirm if you are referring to*** theater where you watch plays and not movies theaters.
> 
> ***I'm not very familiar with this area***, but I know that theater has a long history in my country. From emperors to ordinary people, everyone listened to plays, so theaters are very common and popular in ancient China. Theaters provide an important entertainment and social venue for people, and most traditional dramas are adapted from historical stories, so it also plays a big role in inheriting history and traditional culture.

How strong a tradition is it today in your country to go to the theatre?
> In my country, the tradition of going to the theatre ***has diminished over the years***. While there are still people who appreciate live performances and value traditional arts, it is not as prevalent as it used to be. The younger generation seems to prefer ***modern forms of entertainment*** such as movies, concerts, and digital media, which ***have gained popularity in recent times***.

Do you think the theatre should be run as a business or as a public service?
> In my opinion, the theatre ***can benefit from a combination of both*** business and public service models. By operating as a business, the theatre can ***generate revenue***, attract investment, and ***sustain itself financially***. However, it's equally important for the theatre to serve as a public service, ***ensuring accessibility to*** a diverse audience, ***promoting cultural enrichment***, and ***preserving*** artistic traditions. ***Striking a balance between the two approaches*** can help the theatre thrive while ***fulfilling its broader societal role.***

## Arriving early & Being patient (12-1)
1. In what kinds of situations should people always arrive early?
> It is crucial in situations ***where punctuality is highly valued***, such as Job interviews, important meetings, and academic examinations, these are some examples where being early ***demonstrates professionalism, respect, and preparedness.*** Additionally, for public events or appointments with ***limited seating or availability***, arriving early ***ensures securing a spot or service without unnecessary stress***.

2. How important it is to arrive early in your country?
> Arriving early ***holds varying degrees of importance across different regions*** in my country. ***In major cities***, punctuality is highly valued, particularly ***in professional settings***. However, in my hometown, a small inland city, the pace is more relaxed, and people ***tend to be a bit more laid-back about timing***. For instance, if you plan to ***meet for lunch*** at 12 o'clock, ***it's often wise to suggest 11 o'clock initially***, as people might arrive a little later. ***Nevertheless, punctual individuals are always appreciated regardless of the location.***

3. How can modern technology help people to arrive early?
> Well, you know, modern technology can ***be a real game-changer*** when it comes to arriving early. One way it helps is through navigation apps like Google Maps, which offer real-time traffic updates and alternative routes to avoid congestion. Additionally, ***smartphone reminders*** and alarms can ***keep us on track*** and ***prompt us to leave early***. Moreover, public transport apps provide schedules and live updates, ensuring we can plan our journeys more efficiently. ***All in all***, technology is definitely ***a handy tool*** to beat the clock and be on time.

4. What kinds of jobs require the most patience?
> Oh, for sure! Some jobs really demand ***a ton of patience***. One example is customer service roles, where you have to deal with all sorts of people and their complaints. Another one would be teaching, especially with young kids – you need ***oodles of patience*** to keep them engaged and motivated. And let's not forget about healthcare professionals, where you need ***immense*** patience to handle patients' needs and emotions. Overall, any job that ***involves interacting with people*** and requires ***a steady temperament*** would benefit from ***a hefty dose of patience***.

5. Is it always better to be patient in work (or studies)?
> Absolutely yes! Patience ***plays a crucial role in both work and studies***. When collaborating with others, ***varying levels of understanding*** can lead to communication challenges, and staying patient helps ***maintain a positive team dynamic***. Nobody enjoys working with impatient and irritable colleagues; instead, people prefer those who remain calm and composed. Moreover, many rewarding jobs ***demand long-term dedication***, and patience becomes essential to persist through challenges until achieving success. It's a valuable quality that can lead to better outcomes and ***harmonious relationships*** ***in both professional and academic settings***.

6. Do you agree or disagree that the older people are, the more patient they are?
> I don't necessarily agree that older people are always more patient. In my view, ***patience is more closely related to one's innate nature rather than age***. Some individuals ***exhibit remarkable patience from a very young age***, while others may struggle with impatience ***even as they grow older***. Life experiences can certainly ***shape one's understanding of patience***, but it remains a ***personal trait that varies from person to person***. Some people may become more patient ***after learning from past mistakes***, while others might not ***introspect*** or attribute failures to some other reasons.


## Choosing work & Work-life balance (13 - 1)
1. What kinds of jobs do young people not want to do in your country?
> In China, there are certain jobs that young people tend to avoid. For instance, ***labor-intensive jobs*** like agricultural work or construction may not be appealing due to the physically demanding nature and relatively lower pay. Similarly, jobs in manufacturing industries, such as assembly line work, may not be preferred as they ***are often associated with repetitive tasks and limited career advancement opportunities***. Moreover, certain service-oriented roles, such as cleaning or garbage collection, might not be popular choices ***among young people*** due to ***the perceived social status and remuneration.*** Instead, many young individuals in China often ***aspire to work in tech-related fields***, finance, or creative industries, ***which are seen as more prestigious and promising in terms of career growth and remuneration.***


2. What kinds of jobs do young people not want to do in your country?
> Well, ***I think there is no definite conclusion***. Parents can provide resources and support to ***kickstart their children's careers*** with their own expertise and connections, saving them time and effort. On the other hand, teachers often have a better understanding of market trends and can ***offer insights into*** future job developments. Ultimately, a combination of their guidance can be the most beneficial for young individuals, as they ***bring different perspectives and knowledge to the table***.

3. Is money always the most important thing when choosing a job?
> In my opinion, ***this statement is true for the most part***. 
> 
> For most people, ***making a living is a primary concern***, as we need to meet our basic needs first. Of course, I know money ***is not the sole consideration / not the whole story***; some might also prioritize other values like passion, work-life balance, or personal fulfillment. 
> 
> However, ***money can indeed complement these other aspirations***. With a solid financial foundation, we can more easily pursue higher goals and invest in hobbies, ***making it more likely to lead the life we truly desire***. For instance, a high-paying job could offer the opportunity to retire early and have the means to fulfill our dreams.

4. Do you agree that many people nowadays are under pressure to work longer hours and take less holiday?
> Yes, at least in China, most young people, ***including myself, are compelled to*** work for more than 8 hours a day, and some companies even expect regular overtime work on Saturdays. Moreover, most companies don't ***pay proper overtime compensation as mandated by labor laws***. This situation is both disturbing and prevalent, and unfortunately, ***it seems to be tolerated by the government***.
>
> In China, ***there's a practice known as*** "make-up days on public holidays," where holidays are moved to the nearest Friday or Monday to create longer breaks with weekends. However, this doesn't increase the total number of holidays, and ***resulting in longer consecutive workdays***. Unfortunately, this can negatively impact the physical and mental health of workers, posing a significant challenge in maintaining work-life balance.

5. What is the impact on society of people having a poor work-life balance?
> Having a poor work-life balance can significantly impact society in various ways. 
> 
> Firstly, it may lead to increased stress and ***burnout*** among individuals, ***affecting their overall well-being and productivity***. ***This, in turn, could result in a decrease in*** overall work efficiency and ***hinder*** societal progress. 
> 
> Moreover, ***strained*** work-life balance may lead to strained relationships, affecting family dynamics and potentially contributing to social issues. Therefore, promoting a healthy work-life balance is essential for the well-being of individuals and the ***smooth functioning of society as a whole.***

6. How to improve work-life balance?
> Improving work-life balance is essential for our well-being. 
> 
> Firstly, ***setting clear boundaries between work and personal time*** can help. For instance, avoiding bringing work back home and checking work emails during leisure hours.
> 
> Secondly, prioritizing self-care activities like exercise, meditation, or ***spending quality time with loved ones*** can ***recharge us mentally and emotionally***. 
> 
> Lastly, ***from employers' perspectives***, they can support employees by offering flexible working hours or remote work options, promoting a healthier balance between professional and personal life.

## Buy Time
I suppose there are many reasons

Do something in all kinds of ways

That’s sort of hard to answer, it’s a pretty controversial issue

That’s a tough question for me, **I’ve never thought about it before**

## Counter Argument
I know I can’t deny that …, but I just really think that **in most circumstances/cases**, it’s **the other way around**.

But, we can also consider it this way

## Opinion
Theaters may be **better off** being operated as private businesses.


## Mean
I think this issue needs to be discussed **on a case-by-case basis**.

## Find job
"I have a bachelor's degree in nuclear physics and a master's degree in IT. This interdisciplinary background gives me a competitive advantage when searching for jobs.

Recently(Not long ago this year), I was promoted to lead a small team this year. While this brought a more substantial salary increase, it also came with(brought along) additional workload and responsibilities. When I was solely a developer, I only had to focus on technical issues, but now there are many more factors to consider. Although I've been trying to adapt quickly to my new role, I can clearly feel the fatigue. Often, *when I get home after work*, I feel completely burned out."

I'm currently exploring suitable positions in companies that value work-life balance. This is *one of my main purposes for* taking the IELTS, as having a language proficiency certification can to some extent enable me to consider roles in multinational corporations or *overseas* opportunities."

Out of interest, I studied nuclear physics during my undergraduate years. 

However, *when I was in my senior year* searching for a job, things didn't go smoothly as expected. 

Many companies related to my major, such as nuclear power plants and energy companies, didn't ***spark much interest in me***. I felt quite frustrated during that period.

Initially, I just wanted to ask him out for dinner and have a chat. I was quite distressed.

After hearing about my current situation, he suggested, "Have you ever thought about applying for positions in internet companies? It seems like a good option in terms of work environment and income."

***I must say that*** this suggestion greatly changed the course of my career.

In fact, I had also heard about the various benefits of the thriving internet companies these days. I even checked out job postings from some companies. 

However, since I wasn't a computer science major, I realized that I didn't meet the requirements for some of the positions that interested me. As a result, ***I didn't pursue them further.***

For example, they might require you to be familiar with certain programming languages and have around two to three years of programming/coding experience.

But my classmates informed me that the actual *recruitment* requirements for these specialized backgrounds weren't as *rigid* as I thought. 

For some companies experiencing rapid growth, the demand for recruitment was quite high. 

They were even open to considering students with non-computer science majors, especially those with backgrounds in *foundational* sciences like physics or mathematics. 

They believed that these students had strong mathematical foundations and logical thinking skills, which would enable them to quickly grasp programming skills and most importantly, have better development potential. 

He strongly encouraged me to submit applications and give it a try. As it turned out, his advice was entirely accurate. 

I started self-learning(self-study/ teach myself) programming while simultaneously applying for positions and attending interviews. Finally, before I graduated, I even received offers from several different companies. 

If *it wasn't for* that conversation with him, I *wouldn't have known* this information, and I wouldn't have had the *subsequent* job opportunities. So, I'm truly grateful to him.

## Living condition
My place is about a 20-minute drive from the city center.

Both my wife and I work in Guangzhou, so when choosing a place to live, our *primary consideration* is its *proximity* to our workplaces.

Lately, we've been *considering/contemplating* buying a car, but *upon further investigation(after delving deeper into the matter/upon taking a more in-depth look)*, we've discovered that there are several restrictions to driving in Guangzhou. These include limitations on access to the *downtown area* during peak hours, parking challenges, and various policy differences between *conventional(traditional/gasoline)* and electric vehicles.

Recently, the government has been actively promoting electric vehicles. Purchasing an electric car may come with benefits such as reductions in registration fees and taxes."



## Pending
James White gave me your number. I hope you don't ***mind*** me calling you.

I didn't do well in my exams at school and I was really worried because I failed Maths. But ***it didn't actually matter*** because I did lots of ***courses*** on the job.

Yes. That sounds good. I took the one on IT skills but I wish I'd done that one instead.

What about the other trainees? How did you ***get on with*** them?

we were all ***around*** the same age

***It seems like*** there are a lot of opportunities there.

Because of its size you can work in ***loads of*** different areas within the organization.

You're given lots of different things to do. I enjoyed it all - I didn't even ***mind*** the studying.

Yes, it's on the 23rd of this month.

***So long as*** you're well prepared there's nothing to worry about. Everyone's very friendly.

I never wear ***jeans[plural]*** to work.

I'll have to practice doing that ***in the mirror***!

At the weekend, we have the team relay event, and you're all welcome to join in.

Participation rather than winning is the main focus

Participants are in teams of two to four

For your final expedition, you'll head off to Mount Frenner wearing a pair of special snow shoes which allow you to walk on top of the snow.

Attempts to trace the whereabouts of a man seen leaving the scene of the crime have so far been unsuccessful.

The burglars were careful not to leave any tracks behind them.

Passengers are requested not to walk across the tracks.

The dogs are trained to follow the trail left by the fox.

It's a long ascent, though not too steep

Don't stress about getting back here to the centre in time to catch the airport bus - they'll probably not be running anyway.

Regardless of their age or skill

Stony Trail's a good choice once you've got **a general idea of the basics**.

And the display takes place **on the opposite side of** the river.

I think that'll keep me busy **for the whole of my stay in Kenton**.

I can **get by** when I talk to people, though I'm not terribly accurate.

So what would you advise me to aim at in the paper?

I'll give you the details **in a moment**.

And then you should start looking for suitable articles and books to **draw on**.

It often carries a **connotation** of achieving meaningful results or **yielding valuable benefits over the long term**.

Could you provide two representative examples for each of the words.

Please correct and naturalize this sentence as a native speaker would.
